It will be used to transport\npayloads for an array of applications, orbit altitudes and inclinations. The Space Rider is composed of an expendable\nAVUM Orbital Module (AOM) and of a reusable Reentry Module (RM), which is designed to be flown multiple\ntimes. For the RM this translates into the need for a flexible and robust system, able to cope with a wide range of\nflight conditions, in compliance to stringent safety constraints in case of failure. This is a critical additional challenge\nfor Europe, beyond the current state of the art in re-entry technology represented by the successful flight of the ESA\nIXV (Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle) on February, 11th, 2015.\nThis paper presents the current status of the Space Rider Mission and the Mission Engineering results achieved by\nDEIMOS Space at the System Preliminary Design Review (SPDR). The Mission Engineering is a design process that\nincludes multiple activities in support to the mission and system design: from aerodynamics and flying qualities\naspects to End-to-End (de-orbiting to touchdown) reference trajectories optimization, sizing trajectories for\nsubsystems specifications, assessment of the mission performance through Monte Carlo simulation campaigns, and\nvisibility and safety analyses.\n\n**1.** **Introduction**\n\nOn February, 11th, 2015, the successful flight of the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) allowed\ndemonstrating the European independent capability to return from space. IXV (Figure 2) was a lifting body vehicle\nwith two movable flaps for aerodynamic control that performed a suborbital mission, allowing in-flight\ndemonstration of critical technologies for hypersonic flight conditions and successive re-entry from LEO. After\nbeing injected by VEGA in a 400km altitude orbit, IXV performed a successful entry targeting the desired parachutes\ntriggering conditions, to start the final descent for a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.\nLeveraging on IXV development, qualification and mission success, intended as an European “intermediate” step\ntoward multiple future space applications, the European Space Agency (ESA) initiated an effort to develop a\nsustainable reusable European space transportation system integrated with the VEGA C launcher, the Space Rider\n(SR) currently under development, to enable routine launch and return space missions [1]. VEGA C and the Space\nRider constitute an Integrated Space Transportation System (ISTS, Figure 1), composed by:\n\n - Module 1 = the Launch and AVUM Orbital Module (AOM), physically consisting of the Vega C launcher\nwith a specifically adapted AVUM, with the latter acting as orbital service module up to de-orbit boost and\nseparation from the Re-entry Module (RM).\n\n - Module 2 = the Re-entry Module (RM), starting its active role at orbit acquisition, performing the in-orbit\npayload operations with the AOM support, and remaining active until completion of landing on ground.\n\nThe Space Rider RM will have a Multi-Purpose Cargo Bay (MPCB) able to integrate a number of modular payloads\nto fulfil multiple mission objectives and to perform experimentation of payloads for multiple space applications.\nDesigned to be an operational demonstrator able to perform at least 5 missions, the Space Rider will have to support\norbital operations in multiple orbital scenarios, from SSO to equatorial, deorbit and flight back to Earth with high\nmanoeuvrability and controllability throughout all flight regimes (i.e. hypersonic, supersonic, transonic, subsonic) to\nperform a safe and precise soft-landing on ground under parafoil. The vehicle is therefore required to have the\nflexibility to ensure that environmental and operational unexpected events are mitigated and to guarantee the\naccomplishment of the mission objectives in compliance to stringent safety constraints in case of failure.\n\nCopyright © 2019 by author(s).

Also, IXV used a supersonic drogue chute, and hence it did not fly through the transonic regime.\nMoreover, the SR is an operational vehicle, that will support a range of mission types. Hence SR presents new\nchallenges for the mission design of the coasting and re-entry phase and requires the development of European\ncapabilities to fly the lifting vehicle aeroshape through the transonic regime, which places in particular constraints\nand challenges on the vehicle’s flying qualities during the lower Mach regime from Mach 1.2 to Mach 0.7.\nDEIMOS Space is in charge of the Mission Engineering activities, currently at the System PDR, including end-toend Mission Analysis and Flying Qualities, for the Space Rider, a role that also had in the successful IXV, from the\ndesign phase up to launch and flight operations [2].\nThis paper presents the Mission Engineering activities of the Space Rider vehicle carried out in the phase B of the\nprogramme in support to the System Preliminary Design Review (SPDR). The assessment of the orbital scenarios\nand the definition of the re-entry opportunities were performed, to target the desired landing site within the proposed\nlanding site network. The specification of the optimum Centre of Gravity (CoG) box compatible with the layout\ncapabilities was carried out, in addition to the characterization of the Entry Corridor for trajectory design (focusing in\nparticular on the supersonic and transonic phases not covered by the IXV), the selection of the optimum Angle of\nAttack (AoA) trim line to be flown, and the associated Flying Qualities performance. End-to-end (de-orbiting to\ntouchdown) optimum reference trajectories were computed, as well as sizing trajectories for subsystems\nspecifications (e.g. TPS, parachutes), and the mission performance were assessed through Monte Carlo simulation\ncampaigns. Finally, the analysis of the visibility of the SR from ground stations during the flight was carried out, as\nwell as the analysis of the telemetry link during the orbital phase, and safety analyses (off-nominal footprints) were\nexecuted in order to verify the compliance with the applicable safety requirements.\n\n**2.** **Space Rider Mission and Vehicle Overview**\n\nAt the beginning of the SR programme, a trade off was carried out to at first select the most appropriate aeroshape\nclass among different classes, and then define the baseline configuration within the selected class [3]. The current\nbaseline design of the Space Rider RM has the same aeroshape and size as the IXV (shown in Figure 4). The SR RM\nis a lifting body, with no wings, and provides a lift-to-drag ratio of about 0.7 in the hypersonic regime.\nWith respect to the IXV mission, the SR mission will have to support orbital operations in multiple orbital scenarios,\ndeorbit and re-entry to perform a safe and precise soft-landing on ground under parafoil (Figure 3). In particular:\n\n - The SR ISTS is launched from Kourou onboard the Vega C launcher and injected into orbit.\n\n - During the orbital phase the SR objective is to accomplish the goals for the specific orbital mission. Target\norbits currently considered are circular, have an altitude of 400 km, and with an inclination range from\nequatorial to SSO, depending on the mission objectives.\n\n - At deorbiting, the SR executes a deorbit boost to target the desired conditions at the EIP. After the boost is\ncompleted, the RM separates from the AOM and performs a ballistic coasting phase prior to entry. Attitude\ncontrol during this phase is carried out by means of the Reaction Control System (RCS). The targeted\nconditions at the EIP are typical of LEO return missions, with co-rotating velocities beyond 7.4 km/s.\n\n - The RM then performs a guided gliding re-entry from the EIP until low supersonic regime (at Mach 1.6),\nwhen transition into TAEM phase occurs. The TAEM phase objective is to get the vehicle to the desired\nconditions (position, velocity, attitude) at the DRS triggering.\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nSpace Rider Mission Engineering\n\n - At approximately Mach 0.73 the DRS sequence (this terminology was inherited by IXV) is triggered, and a\npilot chute, a conical ribbon drogue, and a Disk-Gap-Band drogue are deployed successively to slow the\nvehicle down toward the desired conditions for the parafoil deployment, that occurs at 6 km of altitude and\nabout Mach 0.12. The parafoil allows to glide with a shallow flight path angle and to manoeuvre to reach\nthe desired landing site.\n\n - The flight terminates with an approach and landing phase at the desired landing site.

In this phase the\nvehicle performs a flare manoeuvre to achieve the proper touchdown conditions.\nMultiple orbital mission scenarios have been considered, according to the system needs and specifications provided.\nThe process has been highly dynamic with the main objective of contributing to the feasibility verification of the\nmission scenarios under investigation from the mission analysis standpoint. Orbital mission analyses were provided\nto support the orbital mission definition for different orbital scenarios and payloads (e.g. microgravity, Earth\nobservation). Depending on the orbital scenario, different landing sites were considered, and different vehicle\nconfigurations are possible. Therefore, the Entry and TAEM phases could vary accordingly. In particular, the reentry phase will depend on the co-rotating velocity and the FPA at the EIP, the RM mass, and the targeted\ndownrange to be flown during entry. For the SPDR, up to 8 different return mission scenarios (Case 1 to Case 8)\nhave been considered (see Figure 5). Feasible return solutions have been identified for each one of them, including\nthe definition of E2E reference return trajectories from de-orbiting to touchdown.

Results were obtained\nwith on 3DoF and 6DoF simulations which leverage on the orbital aerodynamic database developed by DEIMOS\nSpace for the AOM+RM assembly considering 4 different orientations of the solar panels attached to the AOM (see\n\nThe analysis of the environmental perturbations showed that the aerodynamic torques and gravity harmonics\naccelerations are the dominant effects, while for example the solar radiation pressure has a negligible impact in\ncomparison to the two main contributors. Results supported the sizing of the orbital GNC and to guarantee proper\nenvironment for the selected payload applications in orbit.\nThe Sun direction relative to the SR vehicle was studied for different scenarios and launch dates, showing that there\nare some orientations where the Sun is not present. This result could support the thermal analyses and the definition\nof an optimum radiation panel direction for the thermal control of the P/L environment.\nComplementary to the environmental perturbations’ analysis, 6DoF simulations were performed to evaluate their\nimpact on the attitude stability of SR in open loop. Moreover, worst case scenarios were identified as the sizing cases\nin terms of the orbit decay assessment. The results (see Figure 8) showed a clear dependency of the orbit decay on\nthe launch epoch, resulting in a higher fuel consumption (~15 kg in year 2025 against ~5 kg in year 2021) when orbit\nkeeping is required (e.g. for Earth observation missions) and a higher orbit altitude loss in case of orbit keeping\nmaneuvers are not applied (55 km against 9 km, respectively) for missions flying during the peak of the solar activity\ncycle (see Figure 7). As a result, a dedicated analysis for specific payload and launch date should be tailored in order\nto develop a detailed assessment of the needed requirements regarding the orbit decay. Furthermore, the results of the\n6DoF orbital analysis could be useful to support the definition of the orbital GNC needs.\n\nthe orbital phase mission analysis\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nSpace Rider Mission Engineering\n\n**4.** **Re-entry Module Configuration Design**", "char_len": 4025}

The optimum AoA profile is obtained from an end to end\nanalysis of the vehicle flying qualities and flight mechanics performance in the full range of flight regimes covered\nby the mission: from rarefied flow, through hypersonic, supersonic and down to subsonic.\nThe AoA profile (trim line) is the result of a trim process (null moments) where, for a given aerodynamic shape, the\nvehicle Centre of Gravity (CoG) location play a key role in combination with the aerodynamic surface deflections.\nBasically, for a given CoG location, an AoA-Mach corridor can be obtained: in this way it is possible to map the\nfeasible CoG locations that are compatible with the applicable constraints and under within the applicable\ndispersions. In the IXV mission engineering [2], an overall design process was implemented where key vehicle\nparameters (CoG, AoA profile, Elevators deflections) were coupled through flying qualities (trim, stability and\ncontrollability aspects) and detailed mission analysis performance (thermo mechanical loads, landing accuracy,\nvisibility and link budget, safety aspects…) that derived from the trajectory simulation and entry corridor design\n(where the bank angle profile is also optimized). This approach allows the definition of optimum and robust design\nsolutions guaranteeing feasibility and margins coupling the AoA-Mach corridor (Flying Qualities) with the dragvelocity Entry Corridor (Trajectory Design).\nFor Space Rider, a similar process was applied, and extended to the transonic and subsonic regimes, not covered by\nthe IXV. Additionally, another degree of freedom was added to the problem, that is the variability of the aeroshape.\nAt the beginning of the study, in phase A, a trade-off on the candidate aeroshape classes was carried out [3], resulting\nin the selection of the Lifting Body as baseline aeroshape class. Within the Lifting Body class, two options were\nanalyzed: the IXV aeroshape, and the IXV aeroshape with fins. On one side, the IXV aeroshape maximized the IXV\nheritage from any perspective and ensured the extension of fly-ability envelope down to transonic and subsonic\nregimes. On the other, the IXV with fins was a promising variant especially in terms of maximization of the vehicle\nflight capability, and lateral-directional static and dynamic stability, even if with significant drawbacks in terms of\nmass increase, structural modifications and an additional effort for the characterization of the aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics properties. In this context, Flying Qualities (FQs) analyses were carried out to support the trade\nbetween the two solutions. The results confirmed the possibility to cross the transonic/subsonic regimes with the IXV\nconfiguration, that was the selected as the baseline solution for the Space Rider Preliminary design [4].\nOnce the configuration was selected, Feasible Domain (FD) analyses were carried out to support system trade-offs\ndecision on the vehicle configuration design, in particular in the selection of a robust nominal CoG location that\nresults into satisfactory FQ Entry Corridor performance (margins with respect to FQ constraints). An analysis much\nwider and detailed than in IXV (see Figure 9) was carried out. Overall, about 1.7 million Monte Carlo shots were\nprocessed. Results show that the entry corridor shrinks in the subsonic regime, due to limits in trim constraints.\n\nWhile the IXV entry finished at Mach 1.5 (where the\ncorridor was more than 10º width), in Space Rider the\nobjective is to fly the challenging transonic phase and the\ncorridor is less than 5º below Mach 0.85. Depending on\nthe set of constraints, and on the flap range available for\ntrim, CoGs for which the Entry Corridors opens up down\nto Mach 0.6 could be identified (see Figure 10). In\ngeneral, the CoG range explored allows playing with\nabout 1º of Entry Corridor width at the same Mach (in\nthe region of Mach < 0.85). Punctual issues around Mach\n0.82 exist for a subset of the CoG. Overall, the IXV CoG\nis confirmed to be a feasible solution, even if it is not the\nnumerical optimum at FD level. Other CoGs offer better\nperformance, in particular at Mach 0.73 (nominal DRS)\ncases with 2º corridor width exist (vs 1º for IXV CoG),\nand the most promising region to be investigated at\n\nsystem level for the design of the vehicle CoG were\nidentified.\n\nThe software used to perform all the Flying Qualities analyses is the DEIMOS Space S.L.U. FQA Analysis Tool that\nhas also been extensively used in multiple projects of the European Space Agency [5]. More details and results of\nboth FQs and trajectory design are presented in the next sections.\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nDavide Bonetti, Gabriele De Zaiacomo, Gonzalo Blanco, Giovanni Medici, Irene Pontijas, Baltazar Parreira\n\n**5.** **Flying Qualities**", "char_len": 5088}

Flying Qualities (FQ) are evaluated with dedicated Monte\nCarlo functionalities of the FQA Tool in order to characterize the trim, stability, and control characteristics, and\nmargins as input to GNC activities.\nFor the baseline configuration selected, a trim line design solution was identified within the available entry corridor:\nthe IXV solution for the hypersonic and supersonic regimes was confirmed for the Space Rider, and a feasible trim\nline was designed for the low supersonic, transonic and supersonic phase (Figure 11).\nResults presented in this section are based on a Monte Carlo campaign of 4000 shots including uncertainties on\naerodynamics, AoA tracking, inertia properties, dynamic pressure, CoG location and GNC allocation in all flight\nregimes. The evaluated FQs comprise trim characteristics, static and dynamic stability, dynamic couplings, spin\ntendency, and hinge moment needs. FQ verification showed good performances in hypersonic as long as a trim is\nachievable with aerodynamic means (dynamic pressure > 250 Pa), with a slightly undamped Dutch Roll, yet with a\nconsiderable time to double and therefore no possibility to develop during the entry phase. In supersonic/transonic,\nno instability is found in lateral-directional. In supersonic, in terms of longitudinal stability, all cases are stable, while\nduring the transonic regime only 1 case (out of 4000) is unstable between Mach 1.12-1.14, with a minimum time to\ndouble of 1.35 s. On the other hand, the IXV trim approach (i.e. to make use of the aerodynamic surfaces to trim the\nvehicle) shows a more important instability in the subsonic regime below Mach 0.8-0.9 although with a higher time\nto double (about 50 seconds) which indicates that the development of the instability is not likely to occur.\nNevertheless, an alternative approach was investigated: to command a fixed elevon vs Mach profile, while the\nvehicle is allowed to \"free fly\" (i.e. AoA is let free for trim with the aileron and the sideslip angle). This solution is\nvalid from a FQ perspective and it basically leverage on the high pitch stability of the vehicle in transonic/subsonic.\nThe drawback of this “de trim” approach is a wider variability in the AoA that is obtained against a closed loop\ncontrol strategy, that have an impact on the trajectory (a dispersion in AoA leads to a dispersion in L/D and therefore\non the range controllability during free flight) and on the Descent sub-system (a wide dispersion on AoA could\nbecome a challenging requirement for the drogue parachute design).The results obtained showed that the AoA\nvariability is around 10º from Mach 0.9 to Mach 0.6. with a positive static longitudinal stability throughout all the\ntrimline. If this strategy is implemented, all cases are stable below Mach 0.9. Figure 13 shows, for example, the 99%\nrange of variability (blue: lower limit; red: upper limit) with 90% confidence level for the AoA, the trim elevon\ndeflection, and the static margin SM. The static margin is defined as the distance between the actual CoG and the\nposition of the centre of gravity at which stability is neutral (neutral point), and is a static stability indicator. Levels\nof SM above zero are considered satisfactory. The results of the campaign verify and validate that an optimal and\nrobust solution has been designed for the current configuration achieving good overall performances with margins.\nWith the IXV trim approach. the AoA corridor is verified and good performances are validated down to Mach 0.9,\nwith no saturations on the control surfaces, acceptable sideslip variability and no relevant dynamic instabilities.\nBelow Mach 0.9, the \"de trim\" approach is proposed, with very good performance in terms of stability and\ncontrollability. The supersonic, transonic and subsonic FQs have been validated afterwards with the results of the 6\nDoF GNC Monte Carlo for the Entry and TAEM phase [7], in particular the trim performance. The variability from\nthe FQ results properly predicts the variability obtained with the GNC (Figure 12 shows for example the angle of\nsideslip), and the margins assumed in the FQ analyses are appropriate.\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nSpace Rider Mission Engineering\n\nsupersonic/transonic regimes\n\nGNC results\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nDavide Bonetti, Gabriele De Zaiacomo, Gonzalo Blanco, Giovanni Medici, Irene Pontijas, Baltazar Parreira\n\n**6.** **End-to-End Trajectory Design**", "char_len": 4723}

The considered\nconstraints include the deorbit opportunities from the operative orbit to the desired landing site within the landing\nsite network, vehicle thermo-mechanical limits during entry, stability and controllability through the trim line design\nduring hypersonic/supersonic/transonic and subsonic regimes, DRS activation limits and descent system operative\nenvelopes, safety restrictions to the Entry Interface Point (failure footprint) and for the final approach toward the\nlanding site, mass margin policy, and visibility from ground stations.\nFor a given scenario and vehicle configuration, the entry corridor is defined as the flight domain where the vehicle\ncan fly being compliant with the imposed constraints (Figure 14), whose limits are defined by a combination of\ntechnology capability (the technology behind each subsystem defines the design limits), System limitations (it can be\ndecided at System level to limit a subsystem below its capabilities in order to avoid oversizing of the vehicle) and\nmission boundaries (a ceiling limit is designed to ensure no skip-out and return into orbit in case of shallow returns)\nand are never to be exceeded. Within the Entry Corridor, the sizing trajectories are trajectories that activate the\nconstraint that defines the corridor, and are used for the design of a particular system/subsystem that activates a\nparticular constraint. For the Space Rider, sizing trajectories for the heat flux and heat load were computed to support\nthe design of the Thermal Protection System (see Figure 14), for the maximum mass configuration.\nOnce the Entry Corridor is defined, the reference trajectory is computed. The computation of the reference trajectory\nrequires a single end to end optimization process from deorbiting to the triggering of the Descent and Recovery\nSystem (DRS). The objective of the optimized deorbiting and coasting maneuver is to target the desired conditions\n(position, velocity and attitude) at the beginning of the entry phase (at the Entry Interface Point, EIP). These\nconditions have to be compatible with the Entry Corridor limits and with the range capability to reach the desired\nlanding site (see Figure 15). The objective of the entry phase optimization is to calculate an optimum reference\ntrajectory from the EIP to the targeted DRS conditions, compliant with all the entry constraints and assuring\nmaximum margins for the GNC during the entry of the vehicle. The entry optimization is a Full Optimal Control\nProblem that involves several parameters and control profiles. The software used is based on the DEIMOS Space\nS.L.U. Sequential Gradient Restoration Algorithm (SGRA) [6]. SGRA is an indirect full optimal control algorithm\nthat allows the optimization of a control profile along with a determined set of parameters having an effect on the\nproblem under study. Specifically, the optimization code developed for IXV [2] was adapted for the Space Rider.\nFeasible and optimum end-to-end trajectories were computed for the 8 return scenarios considered (see Figure 5),\nproviding margins for the GNC operations within the entry corridor and being compatible with the orbital phases, the\ndescent system operative envelope and the targeted landing sites. The 8 scenarios include return missions from 5.3\ndeg (Quasi-Equatorial), 37 deg (Medium Inclination) and 97 deg (SSO) orbits, with the RM mass range between\n2028 and 2734 kg depending on the vehicle configuration and the orbital mission scenario, and landing to Kourou,\nCuraçao, or Santa Maria (Azores). The variability of the velocity at the EIP, coupled with the wide mass range and\nthe need to fly a given downrange during the entry to assure enough trajectory controllability, forced to target in\nsome cases a shallower entry than for IXV (-1.17 deg vs -1.21 deg). Thermal constrains at the vehicle nose and at the\nflaps, including passive to active oxidation limit for C-SiC Thermal Protection System (TPS) material and transition\nto turbulence, are respected in all cases with margins, as well as the conditions for DRS triggering (see Figure 16).\nPreliminary trajectory solutions were computed for the descent under parafoil phase. For this phase of the flight, the\ntrajectory geometry definition depends strongly on the guidance strategy implemented, and the glide performance\nvary with respect to the parafoil aerodynamic capability, wind loading, and atmospheric density.\n\nThe wind profile has also a profound impact on the trajectory,\nbecause the wind velocity may be comparable to the airspeed. In\norder to guarantee enough margin for trajectory control, the\nmaneuvering energy should be preserved as long as possible. For a\nconstant glide flight, the maneuvering energy corresponds to\naltitude. A design approach based on a Parafoil Target Area (PTA)\nanalysis was developed in DEIMOS to design a safe and reliable\nDRS point and Descent trajectory, taking into account the effect on\nthe parafoil flight capability (defined through the equivalent\naltitude margin) due to System mass, parafoil aerodynamics, and\nthe winds variability in the region of interest (extracted from the\nNOAA database); any safety constraint (e.g. no fly zones) in case\nof failures occurring during the Descent phase, and expected\naccuracy from the GNC (Figure 17).

End-to-End Monte Carlo campaign of 1000 shots have been\nsimulated for the baseline (Case 1: QE orbit, maximum mass, Kourou) and backup (Case 3: MI orbit, maximum\nmass, Santa Maria) scenarios. It comprises the coasting of the RM from the AOM-RM separation until the Entry\nInterface Point, the guided entry and TAEM phase, and the descent under the pilot, subsonic conical ribbon and\nDisk-Gap-Band parachutes. These simulations included a proto-Guidance in close loop derived from the Entry and\nTAEM phases Space Rider Guidance [7], and Navigation and Control performance models inherited from IXV\n\n[2][8]. Simulations have been conducted considering uncertainties in the orbital parameters at separation,\nenvironment, and vehicle characteristics (mass properties, aerodynamics).\nThe dispersions at the EIP strongly depend on the accuracy of the deorbit maneuver. At separation the same\nperformance as per IXV were considered, in order to be conservative (thanks to orbit determination and optimization\nof the de-orbit maneuver the dispersions at SEP are expected to be lower than for IXV), obtaining dispersions at the\nEIP in line with those considered for the IXV qualification (see Figure 19).\nThe entry proto-Guidance is able to compensate the large dispersions at the EIP and achieve performance at\napproximately Mach 1.6 slightly higher than the IXV (6 km vs 5 km obtained by IXV). On the contrary, at the end of\nthe re-entry phase the heading angle is quite different from the reference value ([80 to 105] deg 99% range VS a\nreference value of 104 deg, see Figure 20). This result is expected because the IXV guidance did not track precisely\nthe heading angle: in the IXV mission there were no requirements on the heading value at the DRS, neither on the\nheading dispersion. On the contrary, in order to guarantee a safe landing, the Space Rider needs to fly a very precise\nheading profile in order to implement the safe coastline approach strategy. For this reason, it was suggested to\ninclude heading performance requirements based on applicable safety requirements for the entry and TAEM GNC in\norder to assure that any particular maneuver designed to fly a trajectory respectful of the safety constraint is correctly\ntracked. During entry, the constraints are fulfilled, in particular ATD, while a violation of the dynamic pressure\noccurs toward the end of the Entry phase, for the baseline scenario (see Figure 22). The analysis of these results\npoints to a connection with the poor behavior of the proto-Guidance toward the end of the Entry phase.\nThe TAEM proto-Guidance controls the trajectory during the supersonic and transonic phase and targets the desired\nheading dispersion to guarantee a precise alignment of the trajectory toward the reference DRS conditions (Figure\n23). The pilot triggering is estimated to occur within the DRS box and the in the descent phase the system flies\nmainly within the parachutes operative envelopes (Figure 21). Performance are indicating that iterations at system\nlevels are necessary to converge to a Descent design compatible with specifications that can be derived from these\nanalyses. This is considered as normal work in next design loops. Position accuracy at the targeted parafoil\ndeployment at approximately 6 km of altitude is lower than 9 km, well within the capabilities of the current parafoil\nsolution (see Figure 24).\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nDavide Bonetti, Gabriele De Zaiacomo, Gonzalo Blanco, Giovanni Medici, Irene Pontijas, Baltazar Parreira\n\nperformance (Case 1)\n\nTAEM phase (Case 1)\n\ndeployment condition (Case 3)\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nSpace Rider Mission Engineering\n\n**8.** **Safety Analyses**\n\nIn addition to the footprint for the nominal scenario, the corresponding non-nominal footprint in case of a failure of\nthe Space Rider during the return phases was assessed in order to verify the compliance with the applicable safety\nrequirements. Specific analyses and simulations have been run with the objective of supporting the assessment of\ncasualty risk in case of failures, in particular:\n\n - the RM suffering a GNC failure during aerodynamic flight during the Coasting-Entry-TAEM phases\nleading to an uncontrolled turn and impacting the vehicle as a single object.\n\n - the RM suffering failures at DRS deployment, parafoil deployment, or a parafoil GNC failure (parafoil cut)\nduring the Descent phase leading to an uncontrolled flight and impacting the vehicle as a single object.\n\nFor the first set of failures, at first a preliminary analysis of the casualty risk covering the 8 return mission cases and\nboth re-entry dates, 2021 and 2025, has been preliminary derived by combining the results of the IXV safety\nfootprint [2] with the Space Rider range capability, in line with the safety/risks assessment approach used for the\nphase A/B1 [4]. The analysis was performed considering the Gridded Population of the World Model v4.0 (GPW4", "char_len": 5221}

The analysis was performed considering the Gridded Population of the World Model v4.0 (GPW4\n[9]), extrapolated to the targeted date of the mission (2020). The estimated footprints are shown in Figure 25. The\nworst case in terms of total casualty probability on ground is for the baseline scenario with a return to Kourou (case\n1), with an estimation of 1.93E-04 for the year 2025, with over 99% of the casualty risk contributed by the South\nAmerica region, despite its lower population density w.r.t., for example, Central America. If the probability that this\nevent occurs is set to 1% (as per Space Shuttle Orbiter [11]), the casualty is estimated to be 1.93E-06, compatible\nwith the safety requirements.\nThen, a consolidated casualty risk analysis was carried out, by analyzing a complete GNC loss occurring in any\nmoment of the flight between the separation of the RM from the AOM and the DRS triggering. A Monte Carlo\ncampaign of more than 365.000 shots was run based on free 6-DoF propagation of the RM with the failure (initial\ncondition) occurring at any moment of any of the nominal scenario Monte Carlo trajectories. Touchdown conditions\nwere computed, and the final footprint calculated (see Figure 26). Results show that the casualty risk obtained with\nthe preliminary analysis are conservative, while with a more detailed analysis, the casualty risk figure reduces\nconsiderably. This second approach is suggested as the new applicable one for the estimation of the statistical\nfootprint in next phases.\n\nscenarios Case 1 and Case 6 (right)\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nDavide Bonetti, Gabriele De Zaiacomo, Gonzalo Blanco, Giovanni Medici, Irene Pontijas, Baltazar Parreira\n\nmain track\n\nFor the failures occurring during the Descent phase, the objective of the analysis was to estimate the casualty risk\nassociated but also to verify the hypothesis in safety considered for the PTA analysis (see section 6). DRS triggering,\nparafoil deployment, and parafoil GNC failures were simulated, for each dispersed trajectory considered in the\nMonte Carlo campaigns, assuming an uncontrolled flight from failure event until touchdown. It is remarked that no\nfiltering of the local winds profiles has been carried out (i.e. winds are sampled within the NOAA derive model\nwithout checking is the considered wind is compatible with the airspeed of the vehicle; in other words, winds that\nwould have been NO-GO for landing are still considered, very likely leading to conservative results).\n\nfor a DRS failure for the Case 3 scenario. The\n\nfootprint of the touchdown location is over the\nocean, and well within the footprint assumed for the\nPTA analysis (99% ellipsoid, [5.6 x 8] km semimajor axis). The associated casualty risk is therefore\n0. Similar results have been obtained for the other\n\nfailures, and for both the baseline and backup\nscenarios.\n\nTherefore, no casualty risk is associated to the\ndescent phase, and the safety assessment confirmed\nthat the safety margins assumed for the PTA\nanalysis to take into account a DRS failure are\nconservative.\n\nFurthermore, these analyses confirm that the Safe\nCoastline Approach defined for the design of the\nreference trajectories is correct.

The second one, is to carry out the analysis of the\ntelemetry link during orbital phase through the evaluation of the link budget, aiming to assess if a feasible\ncommunication link is possible between SR and the ground stations.\nA preliminary geometric visibility analysis has been performed for the 8 mission scenarios considered from\ndeorbiting to landing, considering the preliminary baseline GSN solution (Core ESA network, Cooperative network,\nAugmented network, represented by the green, blue and red points respectively in Figure 5) and different ground\nstations masks (elevation > 5º or elevation > 0º). Additionally, an Orbital phase starting 2 months (60 days) before\nthe deorbiting is considered for each scenario.\n\nDOI: 10.13009/EUCASS2019-633\n\nSpace Rider Mission Engineering\n\nvisibility time during the Space Rider Orbital phase\n\n**Orbital scenarios** **GSN**\n\nQuasi-Equatorial (5.3º,\n\n8.7º)\n\nMedium Inclination\n\n(37º)\n\nLibreville, Singapore, Malindi,\n\nKourou\n\nHartebeesthoek, Maspalomas,\nDongara, Masuda, New Norcia,\n\nPerth, Santiago\n\nSSO (97º) Svalbard.

On one hand the obtained signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) is calculated at the ground station, which is dependent on the SR transmitter power and antenna gain, the\ndistance from the SR to the GS, atmospheric path losses, and the characteristics of the GS itself. On the other hand,\nthe required SNR that is needed to establish a communication link with the required specifications is calculated. This\ndepends on the required bit rate and admissible error rate, as well as on other characteristics of the communication\nlink. The feasibility of the communication link can then be evaluated by comparing the obtained SNR with the\nrequired one, and the difference between the two defines the TM margin. The link budget analysis was performed\nusing the worst-case slant range observed for each elevation angle from the geometric visibility analysis results of\nthe orbital phase. Given the uncertainty of some key parameters, the link budget has been focused on a sensitivity\nanalysis that allows evaluating the effect of several design parameters on the feasibility of establishing the telemetry\nlink. More specifically, the combination of values of Tx power and the GS G/T ratio that result in a positive TM\nmargin have been identified, considering different values for the elevation angle and required data rate (Figure 28).\nThe performed analysis can then be used to support decisions on the design of the communication system and/or\nselection of ground stations.\n\n**10.** **Conclusions**\n\nDuring the phase B2 of the Space Rider Mission Analysis, multiple activities have been performed to support the\ntrade-offs at system level for the definition of the baseline vehicle configuration and mission solution. The baseline\nsolution feasibility has been assessed, including high fidelity simulations and optimizations of the complete return\nphase (from deorbiting to touchdown) for multiple mission scenarios, leveraging on consolidated tools and DEIMOS\nSpace Mission Analysis expertise inherited from the IXV mission and the Space Rider phase A. Driving factors that\nshould be tackled in the design consolidation phase of the programme have been identified: consolidation of the\nsystem mass budget, further characterization of the aerodynamic properties in supersonic and subsonic and\nconsolidation of the trim strategy, consolidation of the re-entry Guidance to cope with the Space Rider Entry mission\nneeds, consolidation of the descent system design, and full definition of the ground station network.\nConsiderable variability exists between the different Space Rider mission scenarios in terms of orbit, conditions at\nthe EIP (FPA, velocity), range to be flown during entry and landing sites. These imply the need for a significant\nmissionization process of the Space Rider programme.\nContinuous iterations with System activities are currently ongoing as part of the Mission Analysis activities for the\nphase C of Space Rider, with the overall objective of consolidating the current design toward a successful System\nCritical Design Review.\n\n**Acknowledgments**\n\nThe work has been performed under the Space Rider programme in Phase B2 and funded by the European Space\nAgency.

The project in question is Space Rider Observe Cube (SROC), an innovative ESA\ndemonstration mission carried out by a CubeSat that will be deployed from Space Rider; the mission aims at\ndemonstrating critical capabilities and technologies required to successfully execute a rendezvous and\ndocking mission in a safety-sensitive context. Moreover, the project aims at demonstrating key technologies\nin the area of proximity operations, especially in the domain of in-orbit servicing, space exploration, and\ndebris mitigation.\n\n\nThe trajectory design and optimization are achieved by the update and the enhancement of a Matlab code,\npreviously created by Politecnico di Torino, which interfaces the user with an STK scenario through the STK\nObject model software interface. The synergized use of the two software enables the Matlab function to\niterate different possible trajectory solutions on Astrogator, STK’s tool for trajectory design. The relevant\nresults and properties of these solutions are then saved by the Matlab function in dedicated structures or\nplotted in graphs to help the successive analysis and selection of an optimal Mission Control Sequence. This\nsoftware analysis tool is used to set the optimal Mission Control Sequence for two ConOps for the SROC\nmission: the Observe and the Observe&Retrieve scenarios. Moreover, several deviations from the mission\nphases reported in the ConOps are analysed to assess how they affect the subsequent phases. For each of\nthese possible deviations, it is then verified which respects the constraints on the total duration, total\ndeltaV, and safety for Space Rider.\n\n\nThe mission analysis part of the thesis focuses on the analysis of the illumination conditions and the ground\nstation coverage during the mission. An acceptable Line of Sight angle is required during several phases of\nthe mission since SROC hosts different sensors operating in the visible spectrum to perform its navigation\nfunctions and to take pictures of Space Rider when in its proximity. The ground station coverage is\nfundamental to guarantee the downlink of the mission data and to send the send commands to SROC;\nduring some safety-critical phases, such as the Final Approach, it is fundamental to guarantee a sufficiently\nlong window of GS visibility.\n\n\nFinally, several tools of the software DRAMA are described and used to evaluate the orbital lifetime of SROC\n(OSCAR tool), its re-entry survival prediction, and the associated on-ground risk for any object surviving the\nre-entry phase (SARA tool), and the deltaV cost to be allocated for the debris collision avoidance\n\nmanoeuvres.\n\n\nII\n\n\nIII", "char_len": 3082}

It adopts a standard size and form factor, whose base unit is called ‘U’: as per\nCubeSat Design Specification [1], a 1U CubeSat is a cube with a 10 cm side and a maximum weight of 2 kg.\n\n\nThe adoption of this standard is due to the original goal of this project: to provide affordable access to space\nfor the university and the science community [2]. Indeed, the standardized CubeSat platform can help\nreduce the cost and the duration of the development of a space mission, since it promotes a highly\nmodular, highly integrated system where most, if not all, subsystems can be purchased as COTS products\nfrom many different suppliers. Moreover, standard dimensions enable the use of a container to store the\nCubeSat inside a launcher, thus minimizing flight safety issues and simplifying its accommodation.\n\n\nIn the last years, with the increase in the complexity and performance required by the recent CubeSat\nmission, bigger form factors were used, such as 6U and 12U (used by SROC). A comparison of the volume\nand shape of the most usual form factors is shown in Figure 1.1.", "char_len": 1490}

The mission features Proximity Operations in the\nvicinity of Space Rider, then Docking with the mothership and re-entering Earth with it, while always\nensuring the maximum safety for Space Rider.\n\n\nTo perform this mission, critical technologies and capabilities in the area of proximity operation will be\ndeveloped and tested, thus advancing key technologies in the field of proximity operations. This in-orbit\ndemonstration can provide a great drive forward for nanosatellites application in many fields, such as\ninspection missions, in-orbit servicing, space exploration and debris mitigation.\n\n\nThe SROC mission will advance current CubeSat technology and capabilities with respect to:\n\n\n formation flight, in terms of:\n\n`o` Proximity Navigation\n`o` Guidance and Control\n`o` Communications\n`o` Autonomous operations\n\n - deployment, docking and retrieval of CubeSats:\n\n`o` Guidance, navigation and control algorithms for close approach up to docking\n`o` Deployment and retrieval mechanisms\n`o` Docking systems\n\n space targets observation:\n\n`o` Imaging\n\n\nSince the project aims at demonstrating many in-orbit novelties in a very high safety-sensitive context, it\nmay be imposed to implement the SROC programme through different missions with an increasingly high\nlevel of complexity and safety criticality to Space Rider. For this reason, two possible mission concepts have\nbeen defined:\n\n\n - Baseline case: the Observe & Retrieve scenario is implemented. This means that SROC is deployed\nby Space Rider, performs inspection in its proximity, approaches it, docks with it and it is stowed\ninside its cargo bay to re-enter Earth. This scenario would also benefit the Space Rider programme,\nsince it would demonstrate its capability to deploy and safely retrieve payloads.\n\n Reduced case: the Observe mission is implemented. It consists of a simplified ConOps where SROC\nis not retrieved by Space Rider. Instead, it is safely disposed into space after inspecting SR. This\nscenario could be used if the baseline case were considered too much complex or time-demanding.\nIt is also possible to revert from the Baseline case to the Reduce case in case of off-nominal events\nwhich could prevent a safe docking with Space Rider.\n\n\nBoth the aforementioned ConOps are discussed in Section 2.3. Another possible mission concept, which\nwas considered during the first phases of the project, involved the repetition of multiple deployments and\nretrievals during the same mission; however, this scenario, called Observe & Reuse, was excluded for the\nfirst SROC mission. It is noted that the work of this thesis focuses on the task proposed for the Phase B2 of\nthe project.\n\n_Chapter 1 - Introductoni_", "char_len": 3397}

The project is part\nof ASI’s Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe (PRIDE) and has Avio and Thales Alenia\nSpace as the main manufacturers. Its first flight is currently scheduled for Q4 2024 onboard Vega-C.\n\n\nSpace Rider will operate in LEO and it will be used to provide a space laboratory for many different types of\npayload to operate in orbit for a wide variety of applications in missions lasting for a maximum duration of\ntwo months. Space Rider’s main fields are (bur are not limited to) [5]:\n\n\n Micro-gravity experimentation\n\n In-orbit Demonstration & Validation of technologies for exploration, orbital infrastructure servicing,\nEarth observation, Earth science, and Telecoms.

The 3-axis\ncontrol is achieved using rear flaps. To guarantee the landing of this module, the lifting body shape will\ndecelerate the speed below Mach 0.8, then one or two drogue parachutes will be deployed (at 15-12 km of\naltitude) to decrease the speed even more. Finally, a controllable gliding parachute, called parafoil, will be\ndeployed to control the descent phase and guarantee a nearly horizontal touchdown (at approximately 35\nm/s) with no wheels [6].\n\n_Chapter 1 - Introductoni_", "char_len": 2420}

After the\nintroduction, which aimed on giving some context about the CubeSat standard, the mission and the main\nactors involved in the SROC project, the following Chapters will be discussed:\n\n - **SROC Mission Overview** : the SROC mission is further presented: the mission architecture ( Section\n2.1), a selection of requirements ( Section 2.2) and the different concepts of operations ( Section\n2.3) are discussed. It is also explained why two different ConOps will be considered for this thesis:\nthe Observe&Retrieve and the Observe scenarios. This chapter aims at giving more context to the\nreader, by highlighting the properties of each phase and their subphases, thus explaining the\nconstraints or the goals which drive the successive mission analysis and trajectory optimization. Of\ncourse, it is not presented the entirety of the requirements, as well as the two concepts of\noperation, but only the portion of them that are interesting for the scope of this analysis. Regarding\nthe requirements, only the following are reported:\n\n`o` ConOps Requirements (Sub-section 2.2.1);\n`o` Observation Requirements (Sub-section 2.2.2);\n`o` Orbit & Trajectory (Sub-section 2.2.3).\n\n - **STK Scenario** : this chapter describes the reference system used for the analysis (Section 3.1) and\nthe STK scenario (Section 3.2). This last treatment is divided into two parts: the first one is the\ndescription of the settings of the virtual models of SROC and Space Rider (SR) and the assumptions\nat the foundation of the orbital propagators used (Sub-section 3.2.1). The second part (Sub-section\n3.2.2) describes the nominal Mission Control Sequence (MCS), which is the collection of different\nsegments used by STK to simulate SROC’s relative trajectory to SR.\n\n **Updated Matlab Functions** : it illustrates how the STK scenario and the Matlab functions are used\ntogether to define and optimize SROC’s trajectory (Section 4.1). After describing the functioning of\nthe software foundation for this analysis, the focus switches to two Matlab functions in particular:\nthe IPA optimization one (Section 4.2) and HP definition one (Section 4.3). Only these two functions\nare detailly described since they are the ones that have been mostly changed. The other smaller\nchanges that have been applied to the code are also listed at the beginning of the chapter.\n\n - **Nominal Scenarios Analysis** : after describing how the different software is used to set, analyse, and\noptimize the mission, it is possible to illustrate the analysis performed to study the Nominal\nScenarios. Two Nominal Scenarios are considered: the Observe and the Observe & Retrieve. The\nfirst one will be adopted for the first mission of SROC, while the second one will be the baseline for\nthe successive mission. These tasks were already performed in previous cycles of the mission,\nhowever, they needed to be performed again to be updated, since they referred to an outdated\norbit. The main tasks associated with this update are the following:\n\n`o` Study the ground station visibility analysis (Section 5.1) and propose different solutions to\n\nincrease the duration of the longest visibility window;\n`o` Study both the visibility and the ground station coverage required to perform the Final\n\nApproach after the HP3 (Section 5.2);\n`o` Perform the Desing of Experiment (DoE) to define the best relative trajectory (specifically\n\ncalled Walking Safety Ellipse) during the observation phase;\nFinally, after updating the STK scenario, the Matlab functions, and the Walking Safety Ellipse, the\ndeltaV budget and the total duration breakdown into the duration of the single mission segments\n(referred as “time budget”) for the nominal scenarios are presented (Section 5.4).\n\n - **Variant Scenarios Analysis** : here, one of the most important parts of the work is described: the\nstudy of the variant scenarios which could take place instead of the nominal ones. The main variant\nmission segments, caused by a programmatic or operational event, are analysed and discussed to\nassess the robustness of the SROC mission. For each mission segment considered, the origin of his\ndivergence with the nominal scenario, its impact on the total deltaV and the total duration of the\nmission are presented. For a few variant scenarios which may cause relevant problems for the total\nduration of the mission, possible recovery manoeuvres are discussed. As it will be better explained\n\n_Chapter 1 - Introductoni_\n\nin the relative section, to simplify the analysis, the Hold Point 2 was used as a discontinuity point\nwhere the effects of the variant events prior to it do not impact the successive mission segments.\nTherefore, the Chapter is divided into the following sections:\n\n`o` Variant mission segments before HP2 (Section 6.1);\n`o` Variant mission segments after HP2 (Section 6.2), which also include the analysis of\n\ndifferent manoeuvre to avoid or delay the encounter with Space Rider after the end of the\nproximity operation phase. In fact, because of the drag, SROC drifts more and more away\nfrom SR until it approaches it from behind;\nFinally, all these variant scenarios are summarized in several tables to understand which ones must\nbe labelled as off-nominal. The criteria by which a scenario is defined as off-nominal are also\ndescribed (Section 6.3).\n\n- **DRAMA Analysis** : this final chapter focuses on the different tasks performed using the ESA’s\nsoftware DRAMA and its following tools:\n\n`o` CROC: used to define the mass and volume properties of the spacecraft (Section 7.1);\n`o` ARES and Master used to evaluate the Collision Avoidance Manoeuvres (CAMs) from space\n\ndebris (Section 7.2);\n`o` OSCAR: used to verify that the mission is compliant with ESA’s space debris mitigation for\n\nagency projects", "char_len": 6000}

The KOZ is a fictitious sphere centred in the centre of Space Rider which separates\nthe space which can be traversed by SROC and the space which cannot be used by the satellite; it is a\nconstrained aimed at guaranteeing the safety of Space Rider, which can only be transgressed during\npreviously accepted mission phases (such as the deployment and the Docking and retrieval phase).\n\n_Chapter 2 - SROC Mission Overview_\n\nThe commissioning and performance verification phase consists of preparing the satellite for its nominal\noperations and verifying its critical capability for performing proximity operations in the actual operative\nenvironment. It is composed of two sub-phases: commissioning and performance verification. Figure 2.3\nand Table 2.5 present a recap of this phase.\n\n**t** **t**\n\n_Figure 2.3: CPVP for nominal (5 days) and variant (10 days) commissioning_\n\nThe commissioning phase duration was evaluated considering the commissioning of previous mission\nrunning the Tyvak bus and adding a safety margin. Since the maximum duration of the mission is relatively\nshort, it is fundamental to reduce the maximum duration of this phase by evaluating the maximum number\nof ground stations able to communicate with SR; for this reason, Section 5.1 is dedicated to this analysis. For\nnow, the nominal case considers a 5-day commissioning, while a variant longer than 10 days is considered in\nSection 6.1. In conclusion, the duration is yet to be confirmed, because it is necessary to confirm the\nfollowing information:\n\n Time needed for checking and calibrating the components\n\n Number and duration of passes above the ground stations\n\nDuring this sub-phase SROC is moving along a free flight (FF) trajectory which ends, for the nominal case, at\napproximately 373 km along the positive InTrack with respect to Space Rider (the definition of the RIC\ncoordinate system can be found in Section 3.1).\n\nThe performance verification phase is fundamental to test some critical functions of SROC required to\nexecute proximity manoeuvres; however, the performance of close proximity navigation sensors and of the\npayload cannot be tested this far from the target. Since during this phase Space Rider is very distant, the\nonly capabilities that can be tested are the ones that can be performed using a virtual point. The exact\nsequence of operation is yet to be defined, however, the main capabilities to be tested should be the\nfollowing:\n\n Insertion in a Hold Point (HP1) to stop the drift away from Space Rider;\n\n Collision Avoidance Manoeuvre: at least one artificial CAM, which would use the parameters\ncalculated for a real CAM performed in proximity of Space Rider, should be tested to verify its\ncorrect execution;\n\n Insertion into the Walking Safety Ellipse: again, this manoeuvre uses the parameters that define a\nreal insertion into a trajectory with specific geometrical features (see Section 5.3 for a more indepth definition of the WSE) to observe Space Rider and performs it around a virtual point;\n\n - At **t** iude change: different manoeuvres to control the at **t** iude will be executed to test the system\nperformances in terms of pointing accuracy, stability and slew rate. The exact number of\nmanoeuvres to be tested is yet to be defined;\n\n_Chapter 2 - SROC Mission Overview_\n\n Testing of Space-to-Ground and Ground-to-Space communication links and interoperations with\nSpace Rider MCC;\n\n_Table 2.5: CPVP sub-phases - Observe & Retrieve - Nominal_\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n|Sub-phase|Characteristics|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Commissioning**|_Objectve_: to prepare SROC for<br>nominal operatons<br>_Duraton_: 5 days (target)<br>_Environment_: LEO/FF<br>_Relatve_ _distance_: 1-373 km|_Startng event_: SROC autobeaconing to ground<br>(frst signal acquisiton)<br>_Intermediate events_: <br> <br>Commissioning procedures: RF link<br>establishment, post deployment checkout<br>of platorm subsystems<br> <br>Calibraton of thruster and cameras<br> <br>Test of critcal equipment<br>_Ending event_: post commissioning test passed|\n|**Verifcaton**|_Objectve_: rehearsal of critcal<br>operatons<br>_Duraton_: 2 days (target)<br>_Environment_: LEO/FF<br>_Relatve_ _distance_: ~ 373 km|_Startng event_: Command from ground to start<br>experimental phase<br>_Intermediate events_: <br> <br>Test of HP inserton manoeuvre(s)<br> <br>Test of CAM(s)<br> <br>Test of atude manoeuvre(s)<br> <br>Test of WSE inserton manoeuvre(s)<br> <br>Test of communicaton link (TBC)<br>_Ending event_: Verifcaton test passed|\n\n2.3.1.2 Observe & Retrieve mission: Proximity Operatons Phase i\n\nThis phase is one of the most critical and featuring of the SROC mission since it is when the satellite\nrendezvous Space Rider and then takes pictures of it, thus proving his capabilities of flying in formation with\nSpace Rider and performing proximity operations. It is divided into two sub-phases: Rendezvous sub-phase\n(illustrated in Figure 2.4) and Observation sub-phase (Figure 2.5).\n\ni\n\n_Figure 2.4: IPA + OPA Rendezvous_\n\n_Chapter 2 - SROC Mission Overview_\n\nThe rendezvous sub-phase first starts with an In-Plane Approach (IPA) where SROC uses its propulsion\nsystem to move from HP1 to a position in proximity to HP2 (from the STK simulation it is at 7 km InTrack),\nthen SROC performs a Hold Point insertion manoeuvre to reach HP2 with the desired relative velocity. The\nHP2 was added to switch between the navigation sensor from far-range navigation to close-range navigation\nand as a go/no-go moment where SROC receives from the ground the command to proceed with the\ninspection phase. After the completion of the HP2 SROC performs an Out-of-Plane Approach (OPA) to move\nto negative InTrack and start the Observation phase.\n\n_Figure 2.5: Observation sub-phase_", "char_len": 5998}

To define the number of observation cycles, the\nfollowing factors must be considered:\n\n - The maximum deltaV available (requirement SROC-MIS-060) limits the maximum number of cycles\n\n The minimum SR surface to be covered defines a minimum number of cycles (requirement SROCMIS-040)\n\nFrom previous analyses performed on the WSE and the payload, it was proved that one observation cycle is\nenough to meet the requirement SROC-MIS-040. After the WSE insertion, SROC moves along a free flight\nrelative trajectory and takes pictures of Space Rider when it is in payload range. Then after this segment,\nthe satellite keeps moving in a free flight motion, but instead of taking pictures of Space Rider, it sends to\nthe Ground mission data (this segment is called free flight). Defining the correct WSE was a complex task\n(discussed in Section 5.3) which involved considering many different parameters and constraints, such as\nthe total access time of SROC to the Ground Stations during FF or the constraint of not surpassing the 2 km\nInTrack position during the FF to avoid losing the lock of SROC visual navigation sensors on SR.

As mentioned before, this scenario was created in case the Observe & Retrieve scenario is\nconsidered too complex for the first mission; moreover, the Observe & Retrieve scenario was designed to\nrevert back to the Observe scenario in case any off-nominal conditions occur in orbit. This switch can occur\nuntil the final approach is completed.\n\nThis scenario required to analyse its EMP phase (described in Sub-section 6.2.2) since it is fundamental to\nensure that no encounter points with Space Rider will happen and that the spacecraft will still be able to\nperform CAMs to avoid hitting space debris and provide a more sustainable mission for the space\nenvironment. For this reason, SROC will not be passivated immediately after the proximity operation\ncompletions.\n\n_Chapter 2 - SROC Mission Overview_\n\n_Table 2.7: Detailed mission phases for the Observe scenario_\n\n|Mission phase|Mission subphase|Phase description|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Integraton**<br>**& **<br>**Pre-**<br>**Launch Phase (IPLP)**| <br>Integraton Phase<br> <br>Pre-Launch Phase|_Objectve_: SROC is ready for launch<br>_Inital conditon_: SROC/MPCD ready for<br>integraton into SR<br>_Final conditon_: SR ready for launch|\n|**Launch & Early**<br>**Operatons Phase**<br>**(LEOP)**| <br>Launch Phase<br> <br>Deployment Phase|_Objectve_: SROC is released from SR<br>_Inital conditon_: SR is launched<br>_Final conditon_: SROC is distant from SR of at least<br>200 m (TBC)|\n|**Commissioning and**<br>**Performance**<br>**Verifcaton Phase**<br>**(CPVP)**| <br>Commissioning Phase<br> <br>Verifcaton Phase|_Objectve_: SROC is commissioned and all its critcal<br>capabilites for proximity operaton are verifed<br>_Inital conditon_: SROC is distant from SR of at<br>least 200 m (TBC)<br>_Final conditon_: SROC is travelling along a safe<br>trajectory from SR (>300 km)|\n|**Proximity Operatons**<br>**Phase (POP)**| <br>Rendezvous Phase<br> <br>Space Rider Observaton<br>Phase|_Objectve_: SR performs close observaton of SR<br>_Inital conditon_: SROC is travelling along a safe<br>trajectory from SR (>300 km)<br>_Final conditon_: SROC accomplishes the<br>observaton cycle(s)|\n|**End of Mission Phase**<br>**(EMP)**| <br>Disposal Phase<br> <br>Re-entry Phase|_Objectve_: SROC is disposed according to ESA<br>Space Debris Mitgaton<br>_Inital conditon_: SROC accomplishes the<br>observaton cycle(s)<br>_Final conditon_: SROC burned in Earth atmosphere|\n\n## _3 STK Scen", "char_len": 6000}

This is a complex kind of analysis that requires\nthe definition and study of the orbits of all the satellites involved: to simplify it and better understand the\nrelative state of one satellite to another, a Satellite Coordinate System is used [12]. These systems have the\norigin in the centre of mass of a “leader” satellite and move with it; this means that the motion of the other\nsatellite, called “follower”, is evaluated with respect to the leader. Other treaties also use the term “chief”\nfor the leader and the term “deputy” for follower.\n\n\nOne of these systems, called RTN (Radial Transverse Normal) or LVLH (Local Vertical, Local Horizon) is\ncentred in the centre of mass of the “leader” satellite, moves with it and has the following axes:\n\n\n - R axis points out of from the satellite along the geocentric radius vector; the Radial displacement is\nthe one evaluated along this axis\n\n - N axis is normal to the orbital plane; the CrossTrack displacements are the ones evaluated along this\n\naxis\n\n T axis is normal to the position vector and positive in the direction of the velocity vector; the\nAlongTrack displacement is the one evaluated along this axis\n\n\nIf the orbit is circular, the S axis is aligned to the velocity vector: this frame, called RIC (Radial InTrack\nCrossTrack) is the reference system that will be used from here on out (see Figure 3.1 for a comparison with\nRTN).

However, as shown in Figure 3.2, the maximum angle\nbetween Space Rider velocity vector and the InTrack axis of the RIC reference system is approximately 0.08\ndegrees at most, so identifying the distance along the I axis as InTrack generates an almost negligible error.\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n\n_Figure 3.2: Angle between the InTrack axis of the RIC coordinate system and the velocity vector for the first 12 hours of the_\n\n_simulation_\n\n\nInstead, if a propagator which does not consider any of the effects of the non-sphericity of the Earth is used,\nthe angle between this vector is negligible (Figure 3.3).

The simplified HillClohessy-Whiltshire (HCW) equations are obtained by making the following assumptions [11]:\n\n\n1. Small relative position vector magnitude compared to the chief position vector magnitude\n2. Pure Keplerian motion of both the leader and the follower\n3. Leader spacecraft is on a circular orbit\n\n\nThe assumption of the circular orbit for the leader spacecraft has already been discussed; the first\nassumption is respected since, in the nominal scenario, the furthest relative distance is 373 km, which is\none order of magnitude less than Space Rider position vector magnitude (6778.1 km). The pure Keplerian\nmotion assumption is a rough approximation since the STK scenario considers the effects of external forces\nsuch as the atmospheric drag and the solar radiation pressure.

However, the effect of an\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n\nimpulsive manoeuvre can still be assessed, just by using its resulting velocity as the initial condition to\nrestart the analysis.

The radius of the KOZ was also updated from 150 m to 200 m (Figure 3.5) to\ncomply with the new minimum distance required by the Space Rider project.\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n_Figure 3.5: The perimeter of Space Rider's Keep Out Zone in STK_\n\nSpace Rider’s orbit and its properties, as well as SROC’s, were defined using the Astrogator Tool of STK [10].\nThis capability enables specialized analysis for orbit manoeuvring and trajectory design and calculates the\nephemeris of the selected satellite(s) following the Mission Control Sequence (MCS). This sequence is\ncomposed of different mission segments, which are dived into two categories: those that generate\nephemeris (for example a manoeuvre or a propagation segment) and those that affect the execution of the\nMCS. Among this last category, there are two fundamental blocks:\n\n Target sequence: it defines manoeuvres and propagations in terms of the desired goal. What the\ncontrol sequence does is run the segments nested within it and apply the profiles to the run\naccording to its configuration. In this analysis two types of profiles have been used: search (which\ndefines a goal and changes the selected variables to achieve them) and segment configuration\n(which is used to change the configuration of a specified segment inside the target sequence). An\nexample of a target sequence is shown in Figure 3.6: the target sequence “IPA Rendezvous” uses a\nsearch profile (specifically a differential corrector) that evaluates the necessary value for the control\nparameter (in this case thrust during the “IPA Rendezvous Man” manoeuvre) to get the equality\nconstraint (7 km along InTrack at the end of propagation segment “PropToSR”).\n\n_Figure 3.6: Example of a target sequence_\n\n Sequence: this structural element organizes the segments nested within and defines the nature of\nthe results to pass on to the next segment of the MCS. It also allows to set number of times that the\nsequence will run.\n\nTo define the properties of the spacecraft (e.g.: its mass, drag area) and its initial orbit, the segment Initial\nState is used. For Space Rider, the following properties were set:\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n - Dry Mass: 4165 km;\n\n - At **t** iude fixed with TPS towards nadir direction;\n\n Propagator: Space Rider motion is assumed to be controlled, therefore only the effect of the\ngravitation force is considered (JGM2 model with maximum order and degree equal to 4). The Joint\nGravity Model (JGM) version 2 is a model that describes Earth’s gravity field up to degree and order\n70. It was developed by Goddard Space Flight Centre in cooperation with American universities and\nprivate companies [14];\n\nFor SROC the following properties were set:\n\n - Dry mass: 24 km\n\n Drag coefficient: 2.2\n\n - Drag area: 0.06 m [2]\n\n Solar Radiation Pressure coefficient: 1.3\n\n Solar Radiation Pressure area: 0.06 m [2]\n\n - Propagator: it uses the following disturbances:\n\n`o` Gravitational Force: JGM2 with maximum degree and order equal to 4.\n`o` Lunar Third Body Force\n`o` Solar Third Body Force\n`o` Drag Model: drag with MSISE 1990 Atmospheric Density Model. It uses fixed values for the\n\nsolar flux and geomagnetic effects: Daily F 10.7 = 150, Average F 10.7 =150 and K p =3 (they are\nSTK’s default values for the model). The solar radio flux F 10.7 is an indicator of the solar\nactivity which correlates well with the number of sunspots and UV and visible solar\nirradiance records. When this activity changes, the thermospheric density changes too, thus\nvarying the atmospheric drag: the higher the solar activity, the higher the atmospheric drag\n\n[15]. The K p index is used to characterize the magnitude of geomagnetic storms and\ndisturbances in Earth’s magnetic field; geomagnetic storms can produce large short-term\nincreases in upper atmosphere temperature and density, increasing drag on satellites and\nchanging their orbits.\n\n**t**\n\n_Figure 3.7: ESA prediction for the monthly mean F10.7 index [16]_\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\nthe A p index (it is another index comparable to K p but can be easily converted to it using an\nonline converter [17]).

The reason behind\nthis choice is that Space Rider was assumed to be following a controlled orbit, where only the effects of\ngravity are considered. These external forces, especially the atmospheric drag, change the orbital\nparameters of SROC during the mission and can affect, some in a bigger magnitude than the others, the\nrequired deltaV or duration of each manoeuvre.\n\n3.2.2 Mission Control Sequence\n\nThis paragraph describes all the mission segments, in which all the different phases and subphases of the\nmission have been divided to compose the following Mission Control Sequence (MCS).\n\n**PreDeployment** : this phase is used to define all the properties of SROC, which have been discussed in the\nprevious section.\n\n_Figure 3.9: SROC initial trajectory after the deployment_\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n**Deployment** : this impulsive manoeuvre was made to simulate the deployment of SROC from Space Rider’s\nMPCB; for this reason, since it will not be performed in the real mission, the deltaV accounted for this\nmanoeuvre will not be considered in the total deltaV evaluation. A previous study defined this manoeuvre\nto avoid any possible collision/conjunction with Space Rider:\n\n - Azimuth: 180 deg\n\n Elevation: -80 deg\n\n - Magnitude: 0.5 m/sec\n\ndeployment.\n\n_Figure 3.10: SROC deployment overview_\n\n**Commissioning** : this segment is just a propagation one which simulates the free flight during SROC’s\ncommissioning sub-phase. Its stopping condition is the duration: after 5 days the commissioning ends. At\nthe end of this mission segment, the final SROC position is:\n\n - Radial: -10.5 km\n\n - InTrack: 372.9 km\n\n - CrossTrack: -0.007 km\n\nWhat happens during this propagation is that, because of the drag force, SROC decreases its semi-major\naxis (Figure 3.12) and increases its relative speed, especially along the InTrack direction (as shown in Figure\n3.11, where the InTrack position increases exponentially). This behaviour would be seen also if the effects of\nthe drag force were considered for Space Rider’s propagator since it has a bigger ballistic coefficient.\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n_Figure 3.11: RIC components during the commissioning_\n\n_Figure 3.12: SROC semi-major axis during commissioning_\n\n**HP1** : this target sequence simulates the verification sub-phase. As explained in Sub-section 2.3.1.1, since\nthe main manoeuvres to be performed in this sub-phase are yet to be decided, this mission segment was\nonly modelled as a manoeuvre (“Enter HP”) and a propagation segment (“Hold Point)”, with the differential\ncorrector set to ensure that the semi-major axis of SROC at the end of the sequence will be the same as\nSpace Rider’s. As it can be seen from Figure 3.13, the segment shown here is not a proper hold point, since\nthe relative RIC components vary by a few km during it, but it is more a manoeuvre to slow down SROC’s\ndrift from Space Rider. However, this nomenclature was still kept in order to be coherent with the Mission\nAnalysis Report [19]. Finally, the duration has been set temporarily set to 4.5 hours, which was the value\nused for the previous studies. When the Verification sub-phase will be better defined, it is probable that the\nmanoeuvres performed for this segment will change, thus changing its duration and deltaV required.\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n_Figure 3.13: HP1 Trajectory_\n\n**IPA Rendezvous** : this target sequence simulates the In-Plane Approach rendezvous. Its duration is set to\n5.76 days and the InTrack target for the differential corrector is 7 km; these two values are the result of an\noptimization, whose main constraint and objectives are described in Section 4.2. This target sequence\ncomprises an impulsive manoeuvre segment (“IPA Rendezvous Man”) followed by a propagation one\n(“PropToSR”). The control parameter for the differential corrector is the thrust along the V axis of SROC’s\nVNC coordinate reference system.\n\n_Figure 3.14: SROC InTrack during IPA_\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n_Figure 3.15: SROC's relative final motion at the end of the IPA_\n\n**HP2 Insertion** : this target sequence, is again composed of an impulsive manoeuvre segment (“HPInsertion\nMan”) and a propagation segment (“PropToHP”); its duration (2 hours) was evaluated using the same\noptimization process used for the IPA Rendezvous, while the InTrack Target (2 km) was chosen to get SROC\nas close as possible to Space Rider, while also respecting the observation requirements.

The control parameters are again the\nthrust vectors along all three axes of the VNC reference system.\n**HP2 Sequence** : this segment was not part of the first version of the code but was added during the\ndevelopment of this thesis to provide an HP2 more similar to the actual manoeuvre, where the position is\ncontinuously controlled to guarantee an almost constant relative position with respect to the target. The\nmanoeuvre was set to last 4.5 hours. The details about how it works and how it has been defined are\nreported in Section 4.3. The sequence is divided into nested sequences and each of them is composed by\nthe following segments:\n\n HP2 target sequence: it targets the desired relative position, and it is in turn composed of a finite\nmanoeuvre and a propagation segment;\n\n ZeroRelVel target sequence: it sets to zero the relative velocity of SROC;\n\n Propagation segment: SROC freely propagates until its relative position exceeds the maximum error\non the relative position.\n\n**Inspection** : this is another sequence composed of the following segments:\n\n - OPA Rendezvous: it is a target sequence that simulates the Out-Of-Plane Rendezvous from the HP2\nto the insertion to the WSE. It contains one impulsive manoeuvre segment (called “PositionMan”)\nand one propagation segment (called “PropToWSE”). The differential corrector is set to reach the\nfollowing position:\n\n`o` Radial: 0.216 km\n\n`o` InTrack: -0.047 km\n\n`o` CrossTrack: -0.129 km\nThis is the starting point for the WSE, and it is evaluated using a Matlab function described in\nSection 5.3. Figure 3.17 and Figure 3.18 show SROC’s relative trajectory respectively on the InTrackRadial and CrossTrack-Radial planes.\n\n_Figure 3.17: SROC's trajectory during the OPA – InTrack-Radial plane view_\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n_Figure 3.18: SROC's trajectory during the OPA – CrossTrack-Radial plane view_\n\n WSE Insertion: this target sequence is only composed of an impulsive manoeuvre, called\n“VelocityMan”. The target profile sets the desired values for InTrack, Radial and CrossTrack rates,\ndefined by the same Matlab function used to define the WSE insertion point.\n\n Inspection: this segment is just a propagation one lasting 8 hours. It simulates the observation\nphase as one uncontrolled propagation. The impulsive manoeuvre boosts the WSE along negative\nInTrack, then, because of the effect of the drag force, the WSE starts moving along positive InTrack.\nBy doing so the duration of the observation phase increases. Figure 3.19 shows SROC’s relative\ntrajectory during the Inspection.\n\nAlthough the nominal scenario considers only one observation cycle, by considering all these mission\nsegments inside a single sequence, it is easier to add more inspection by simply copying and pasting the\nexternal one.\n\n_Figure 3.19: Last part of the OPA rendezvous (green) and WSE (blue)_\n\n_Chapter 3 - STK Scenario_\n\n**Free Flight** : this propagation segment represents the free flight after the inspection, during which the\nsatellite sends to the Ground the mission data. It presents two stopping conditions and only one of them is\nrequired to stop the propagation: either the duration exceeds 16 hours (which should be more than enough\nto downlink the data) or the relative range exceed 2 km. In the nominal case, the condition which actually\nstops the propagation is the second one, thus causing the duration to last 8.06 hr. Figure 3.20 shows,\nbesides the position and speed in the RIC reference frame, that the range at the end of the free flight is 1.99\nkm. This segment and the WSE could be represented by only one propagation segment since there are no\nmanoeuvres between them. The division between these two is the result of a trade-off between how much\ntime after the WSE insertion can be deputed to the observation and how much is required to send data to\nthe Ground. For the Observe scenario, this is the last segment considered, while for the Observe&Retrieve,\nthe free flight is followed by the HP3 insertion.\n\n_Figure 3.20: Last relative orbits of the free flight propagation_\n\n**HP3 Insertion** : this target sequence has the same structure as the one used for the HP2 insertion; it is\ncomposed of an impulsive manoeuvre segment (“HPInsertion Man”) and a propagation segment\n(“PropToHP”); its duration (2.7 hours) was evaluated using the same optimization process used for the IPA\nRendezvous, while the InTrack Target (0.2 km) was chosen to get SROC just at the limit of Space Rider’s KOZ.\nThe desired results of the differential corrector are all the relative position vectorial components on the RIC\naxes (0 km along CrossTrack, 0.2 km along InTrack and 0 km along Radial) at the end of the propagation\nsegment.

First, it is important to define what makes an IPA the optimal one: the\nminimization of the total deltaV cost required to perform the IPA, the HP2 insertion, and the zeroing of the\nrelative velocity (called ZeroRelVel2 in the MCS). The reason why these three deltaVs are considered\ntogether is that the constraints imposed on the IPA, which are the target position and the duration of the\nsegment itself, determine both the final relative position and velocity of SROC, thus also affecting the\nsuccessive mission segments. The effect on the mission segments after the HP2 is considered negligible\nsince the HP2 always starts at a specific relative position (0 km Radial, 2 km InTrack and 0 km CrossTrack)\nand relative velocity (null).\n\n_Chapter 4 - Updated Matlab Functonsi_\n\n_i_\n\n_Figure 4.2: Diagram showing the functioning of the IPA optimization_\n\nBefore the update, the IPA optimization function evaluated only the deltaV of the IPA itself and the HP2\ninsertion; now it also evaluates the effect on the ZeroRelVel2 manoeuvre. Moreover, the function used to\nevaluate the optimal IPA more times than necessary, thus increasing the run time.\n\nevaluated by considering every combination between the elements of a vector composed of target InTrack\nvalues with the elements of a vector composed of IPA duration values (External Loop). For each\ncombination, the STK scenario is run, and its results are analysed to determine if the solution is valid, which\nmeans that the IPA must fulfil the following constraints:\n\n The IPA final InTrack position obtained in STK must not differ by more than 0.5 km from the desired\nfinal InTrack position;\n\n SROC must not cross below 200 m along the InTrack axis during a 24-hour propagation after the IPA\ncompletion. The Matlab interface with STK is used to add a 24-hour propagation segment, then, at\nthe end of the optimal IPA definition, this segment is eliminated since it does not really occur in the\n\n_Chapter 4 - Updated Matlab Functonsi_\n\nmission ConOps. This condition was added to assess the safety of this manoeuvre in case an offnominal condition prevented SROC to perform the successive manoeuvres for 24 hours; this period\nof time was chosen to simulate the time required to assess the occurrence of a fault and to make SR\nperform a Collision Avoidance Manoeuvre from SROC. Figure 4.3 shows that the 24-hour\npropagation (in green) after the IPA (in red) does not cause SROC to decrease its InTrack distance\nbelow 200 m. In fact, the minimum InTrack distance is approximately 5 km away from Space Rider.\nAt the beginning of the propagation, SROC is moving at a low speed and it is progressively slowed\ndown by the atmospheric drag until its relative speed changes its direction from toward SR to the\nopposite direction. This means that even if this propagation lasted more, it would not change the\nminimum relative distance, but it would only cause SROC to move away even more from SR, thus\nmaking an SR collision avoidance manoeuvre useless.\n\n_i_\n\n_Figure 4.3: trajectory during the 24 hours propagation (green) after the IPA (red)_\n\nIf the IPA iteration is valid, the Inner Loop is started: all the possible HP2 insertions are evaluated iterating\non the duration of the propagation segment during the insertion. The final position is fixed at 0 km along\nCrossTrack, 2 km along InTrack and 0 km along Radial. An HP2 insertion is considered valid if:\n\n The IPA final InTrack position obtained in STK must not differ by more than 0.5 km from the desired\nfinal InTrack position;\n\n SROC must not cross below 200 m along the InTrack axis during the propagation to the insertion\npoint. This constraint was set for safety purposes to avoid SROC from passing through the KOZ or\nflying “behind”, that is in the negative InTrack, SR. Figure 4.4 shows an example of a not-valid HP2\ninsertion manoeuvre: although the final position is the one desired, SROC reaches it by passing\nbehind SR;\n\n_Chapter 4 - Updated Matlab Functonsi_\n\n_i_\n\n_Figure 4.4: Final position of a not valid HP2 insertion_\n\nWhen an HP2 insertion is valid, the successive ZeroRelVel manoeuvre is evaluated and its deltaV cost is\nsaved. After iterating on all the possible HP2 insertions and simulating their relative ZeroRelVel manoeuvres,\nthe optimal insertion, in terms of minimum total deltaV for both the insertion and the ZeroRelVel\nmanoeuvre, is evaluated. It is noted that this is not the absolute optimal result, but only the optimal result\nfor a specific IPA. When the External Loop finishes, which means all the possible IPAs have been evaluated,\nthe optimal IPA + HP2 insertion + ZeroRelVel manoeuvre is determined. Finally, the selected sequence is set\non STK, and the scenario is run to save these changes.\n\nWhile the cost for the IPA is almost the same, the updated version of the code sets an insertion that\nrequires a higher deltaV but guarantees a lower deltaV for the ZeroRelVel manoeuvre. The previous version\nof the code, instead, includes a much less deltaV-consuming insertion, but a much higher ZeroRelVel\nmanoeuvre. This is because it considers only the insertion in the optimization process, so it sets the less\ndeltaV-consuming inspection, with no regard for the cost of the successive manoeuvre.\n\n_Table 4.1: deltaV budget for IPA + HP2 insertion + ZeroRelVel2_\n\n|Mission segment|Previous Code|Updated Code|\n|---|---|---|\n|**IPA Rendezvous deltaV [m/s]**|0.486|0.485|\n|**HP2 Inserton deltaV [m/s]**|0.188|1.280|\n|**ZeroRelVel#2 deltaV [m/s]**|1.877|0.423|\n|**Total Sequence deltaV [m/s]**|2.551|2.188|\n\nAs shown in the lower image, the relative velocity of SROC is almost null for every RIC component: the\nkinetic energy variation required to nullify the relative speed is very low,", "char_len": 6000}

This\nupdate was made to add the following features to the HP segment and the analysis function:\n\n Set a minimum and maximum relative distance during the HP\n\n Model the HP as a sequence of multiple finite burns, instead of a single one\n\nBy doing so it will be possible to change the main properties of the segment if or when more precise\nconstraints will be available. Moreover, this modelling of the HP better reflects what the real segment could\nbe, thus giving a more faithful estimate of the deltaV which is crucial to the scope of this thesis.\n\n **First Propagation** : this propagation segment takes place after the Hold Point insertion and the\nZeroRelVel manoeuvre. Initially, the satellite is exactly at the desired Hold Point relative position (0\nkm along CrossTrack, 2 km along InTrack and 0 km along Radial) with an almost null relative velocity,\nbut because of the effect of the external disturbances it starts accelerating and moves from the\ndesired position. SROC keeps drifting until it reaches either the maximum or the minimum\nacceptable range.\n\n - **HP Burn #n** : this sequence is composed of three sub-segments:\n\n`o` **HP target sequence** : the desired result of its differential corrector is the final relative\n\nposition (0 km along CrossTrack, 2 km along InTrack and 0 km along Radial) and the control\nparameter is the thrust along all the 3 VNC axes of SROC and the duration of the\npropagation segment (“To Target”). It is composed of a finite manoeuvre segment and a\npropagation segment. The target sequence uses three different profiles: the first one is a\ndifferential corrector targeting the aforementioned results considering an impulsive\nmanoeuvre. Then, a second profile, called “Change Maneuver Type” changes the\nmanoeuvre from impulsive to finite. The third profile is a differential corrector targeting the\nsame results but considering a finite manoeuvre. The reason why three profiles were used\n\n_Chapter 4 - Updated Matlab Functonsi_\n\nis that a differential corrector targeting a finite manoeuvre usually requires a representative\nguess for the thrust vectors: by first running the target sequence with an impulsive\nmanoeuvre, its results can be used as the first guess values. Another peculiarity of this\ntarget sequence is that the duration of the propagation segment, called “To Target”, after\nthe manoeuvre is not known in advance: this is why “To Target” ’s duration is one of the\ncontrol parameters of the differential corrector. However, to converge on a solution, it is\nrequired to start with an accurate first guess of the actual final values. For this reason, the\nMatlab function iterates on a vector of possible durations (from longest to shortest) and\nselects the first one which enables the profiles to converge.\n`o` **ZeroRelVel** : this target sequence is identical to the ZeroRelVel segment described in Sub\nsection 3.2.2: its desired result are null relative velocities along all the RIC axes and the\ncontrol parameters are the thrust vectors along the three SROC’s VNC axes.\n`o` **free flight:** this propagation segment is similar to the First Propagation one: because of the\n\nexternal disturbances SROC starts drifting from the desired position until either the rangestopping conditions are met or the Hold Point duration is reached.\n\nThe HP Sequence can be composed of a different number of HP Burn segments, depending on the total\nduration of the HP. If the free flight stops because of the range constraints and the HP is not over, the\nMatlab function adds another HP Burn sequence. Its target sequences are reset and recalculated, as well as\nthe duration of the “To Target” propagation segment. This process is repeated until the HP lasts for the\ndesired duration. Since the desired HP duration may vary between different analyses, before performing\nany action on the whole sequence, the Matlab function erases all the HP Burn sequences except for the first\none, thus avoiding scenarios where the HP sequence at the beginning of the analysis is already longer than\n\nthe desired HP.\n\n_i_\n\n_Figure 4.8: HP sequence segments_\n\nrange error is 11 m, while for the second one is 13 m. These maximum errors show the improvement from\nthe outdated version of the code which had a maximum error of 20 m. Figure 4.10 shows SROC’s trajectory\nin RIC components for HP2 and HP3. Generally, during HP2 SROC tends to oscillate both between a higher\nand lower InTrack with respect to the desired position, while during HP3 it mostly moves to higher InTrack\nvalues. For both HPs, the displacement along the CrossTrack axis is almost negligible. This is probably due to\nthe fact that the biggest disturbance, that is the atmospheric drag, mostly acts on the InTrack and Radial\n\n_Chapter 4 - Updated Matlab Functonsi_\n\npositions: by decreasing the spacecraft speed, it changes its semimajor axis, thus varying the InTrack and\nRadial coordinates.\n\n_i_\n\n_i_\n\n_Figure 4.9: SROC Range as function of the time from the beginning of the HP; HP2 is on the left and HP3 on the right_\n\n_i_\n\n_i_\n\n_Figure 4.10: SROC trajectory as function of the time from the beginning of the HP; HP2 is on the left and HP3 on the right_", "char_len": 5393}

The different behaviour between the two HPs may\nbe due to the fact that the ZeroRelVel manoeuvres, although highly reducing the relative speed, still leave\nSROC with a small relative velocity with respect to SR., which then influences the successive propagation\nsegments. Moreover, a more stable behaviour could be achieved by integrating the actual Simulink model\nof SROC’s propulsion system and GNC algorithms with STK, or at least by mimicking its behaviour with a\nsimpler closed-loop controller. In conclusion, the quality and results of this analysis were still considered\nmore than adequate to evaluate the deltaV required to perform the manoeuvre; in fact, the relative\nposition achieved at the end of both HPs has a relative range error of less than 0.1% and, as seen, before,\nthe maximum absolute range error during the HPs is 13 m for HP3.\n\n_Chapter 4 - Updated Matlab Functonsi_\n\n_Table 4.2: deltaV and duration of all the HP2 segments_\n\n|Segment|Col2|deltaV [m/s]|Duration [sec]|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|First Propagaton|First Propagaton|-|2908|\n|Burn1|HP Man|3.464·10-3|1.960|\n|Burn1|To Target|-|3756|\n|Burn1|ZeroRelVel|5.952·10-3|-|\n|Burn1|free fight|-|1493|\n|Burn2|HP_Man|41.05·10-3|23.22|\n|Burn2|To Target|-|544.2|\n|Burn2|ZeroRelVel|24.12·10-3|-|\n|Burn2|free fight|-|3499|\n|Burn3|HP_Man|11.63·10-3|6.577|\n|Burn3|To Target|-|1722|\n|Burn3|ZeroRelVel|9.820·10-3|-|\n|Burn3|free fight|-|2246|\n|**Total**<br>**0.096**<br>**16200**|**Total**<br>**0.096**<br>**16200**|**Total**<br>**0.096**<br>**16200**|**Total**<br>**0.096**<br>**16200**|\n\n_Table 4.3: deltaV and duration of all the HP2 segments_\n\n|Segment|Col2|deltaV [m/s]|Duration [sec]|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|First Propagaton|First Propagaton|-|3615|\n|Burn1|HP Man|13.22·10-3|7.476|\n|Burn1|To Target|-|1681|\n|Burn1|ZeroRelVel|12.02·10-3|-|\n|Burn1|free fight|-|3999|\n|Burn2|HP_Man|12.90·10-3|7.299|\n|Burn2|To Target|-|1812|\n|Burn2|ZeroRelVel|10.87·10-3|-|\n|Burn2|free fight|-|3583|\n|Burn3|HP_Man|26.61·10-3|15.05|\n|Burn3|To Target|-|818.8|\n|Burn3|ZeroRelVel|17.91·10-3|-|\n|Burn3|free fight|-|661.4|\n|**Total**<br>**0.094**<br>**16200**|**Total**<br>**0.094**<br>**16200**|**Total**<br>**0.094**<br>**16200**|**Total**<br>**0.094**<br>**16200**|", "char_len": 2476}

This property is not particularly crucial for the downlink of mission data during the free flight,\nbut it could be fundamental during the commissioning or the final approach, where a combination of\nproper illumination conditions and ground station coverage is required (see Section 5.2 for more\ninformation). The duration of the longest access window could be increased by considering more already\nexisting ground stations or by creating ad-hoc ground stations. Figure 5.2 shows the GS coverage if another\nground station (LAPAN’s Rumpin Ground Station) is added. By doing so, the longest access changes from\n6.611 minutes to 10.309 minutes thanks to the uninterrupted passage from the additional ground station to\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n\nthe south_sulawesi_LAPAN ground station. However, the possibility to create a significantly longer\nuninterrupted coverage window could not be feasible, since a considerable portion of SROC’s ground track\nis above the sea and not land. Moreover, considering or even building new ground stations would increase\nthe cost and the complexity of the project.\n\n\nAn alternative solution could be to use a GEO satellite constellation to perform data relay of SROC’s data to\nthe Ground. In this scenario, SROC would need a transponder that uses the GEO satellites connectivity;\nthere are already TRL9 COTS available for this application, such as AddValue’s IDRS system [33], which relies\non Inmarsat GEO satellites. Its mass (1 kg) and volume (125x96x70 mm [3] ) are compatible with SROC’s\nremaining mass and volume margins [20]. The real-time connection provided by this service presents the\nfollowing properties:\n\n\n - Network availability higher than 99.5%;\n\n\n - Link budget availability higher than 99%;\n\n\n IP session continuity during rapid GEO satellite spot beam handovers;\n\n\n - Latency: 0.5 – 1.5 seconds end to end;\n\n\n Capability of supporting data rates in excess of 200 Kbps for SROC’s orbit;\n\n\n_Figure 5.3: INMARSAT -4 GEO constellation_\n\nbetween SROC and the constellation was performed and showed that the satellite is always in line of sight\nwith at least one element of the constellation.

As stated by the requirement SROC-MIS-111: “The\nangle between the Sun Vector and the docking axis shall be less than 60 (TBC) deg for the final approach\nand docking”. This angle, also called Line of Sight (LOS) angle in STK, was evaluated from the end of the HP3\nto the end of the analysis time (1st Dec 2024). Figure 5.4 shows the LOS as a function of the time for the\nfirst 24 hours after the end of HP3 while Figure 5.5 zooms on one of the many suitable illumination intervals\nwhen the LOS constrain is respected; specifically, the interval in the image lasts 35 minutes.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n\n_Figure 5.4: LOS angle during the first 24 after the HP3 end_\n\n\n_Figure 5.5: Zoom on one acceptable interval_\n\n\nThe evolution of the LOS angle for the next 29 days is the same as the one reported in Figure 5.4, so from\nthe end of the HP3 onwards, there are many windows with an acceptable illumination (approximately 15\nper day). The next crucial step is to synchronize the start of the Final Approach with a good illumination and\nground station visibility window. Figure 5.6 shows, from top to bottom: the single ground stations visible\nfrom SROC, all the intervals when at least one of them is visible (the brown line referred to as “SROC”), the\nintervals with good illumination, and the windows with both good illumination and GS visibility. If the\nwindows shorter than 3 minutes are discarded from this last set of intervals, the following results are\n\nobtained:\n\n\n Min Duration: 201.7 seconds;\n\n Max Duration: 398.3 seconds;\n\n Mean Duration: 310 seconds;\n\n - Number of Intervals: 13;\n\n\nIn conclusion, the 35 minutes window is reduced to an approximately 6.6-minutes window.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n\n_Figure 5.6: Illumination and GS visibility analysis_\n\n\nOf course, in case the data relay using GEO satellites was considered instead of the direct communication\nwith the ground station, the suitable intervals to perform the Final Approach would coincide with the ones\nwith an acceptable LOS angle, since it would always be possible to communicate with SROC through a GEO\nsatellites constellation.", "char_len": 2461}

A Matlab function evaluates these\nparameters to generate a WSE which satisfies a set of user-defined constraints. Once the WSE insertion\nposition has been defined, it is possible to set the OPA target sequence to get there from the HP2, while the\ndesired insertion velocity becomes the desired result of the WSE insertion target sequence.\n\n5.3.1 Ideal Safety Ellipse\n\nBefore showing the results of the WSE DoE, the geometry of the ideal Safety Ellipse is described, to give\nsome context behind the set of constraints used by the Matlab function to define the WSE. A Safety Ellipse\nis an out-of-plane elliptical period relative trajectory around the target spacecraft such that the chaser\n(SROC) never crosses the primary spacecraft (SR) velocity vector. Since the drift of the two spacecraft would\nnot result in a collision, the trajectory is considered passively safe. Figure 5.7 shows several geometrical\nfeatures of the Safety Ellipse:\n\n - The 𝑋 𝐸 and 𝑌 𝐸 axes lay on the Safety Ellipse Plane. The first axis is parallel to the major axis of the\nellipse and points towards negative CrossTrack; 𝑌 𝐸 is perpendicular to 𝑋 𝐸 and it points toward the\npositive Radial direction. SR’s centre coincides with the centre of the ellipse;\n\n - 𝜒 (polar angle) is the angle between SROC distance from the ellipse’s origin and the 𝑋 𝐸 axis; it is\nequal to zero at the insertion with the 𝑌 𝑅𝐼𝐶 𝑍 𝑅𝐼𝐶 plane and it is positive counter-clockwise.\n\n - 𝑎 𝑆𝐸 and 𝑏 𝑆𝐸 are respectively the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse;\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 5.7: Safety Ellipse Plane_\n\nIt is possible to describe SROC’s position in the Safety Ellipse reference frame as a function of the polar\nangle:\n\n[\n\n𝑎 𝑆𝐸 cos(𝜒)\n𝑏 𝑆𝐸 cos(𝜒)\n\n]\n\n_Figure 5.8: View perpendicular to the Safety Ellipse_\n\nplane and the 𝑋 𝑅𝐼𝐶 𝑌 𝑅𝐼𝐶 plane. Moreover, it also shows the maximum radial distance ( 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) and the\nmaximum CrossTrack distance ( 2𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ). These two values can be evaluated using the following equations:\n\n2𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑎 𝑆𝐸 ∙cos(𝜃)\n\n𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 𝑎 𝑆𝐸 ∙sin(𝜃)\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 5.9: Walking Safety Ellipse offset_\n\nThis safety ellipse, however, does not correspond to the actual trajectory of SROC: since the satellite\nundergoes the effects of the external disturbances and it does not perform any manoeuvre after the WSE to\ncontrast them, its trajectory is modified. The most evident effect is the motion along the positive InTrack\naxis due to the atmospheric drag. For this reason, it is obtained a Walking Safety Ellipse (where “walking”\nrefers to the translation along the InTrack axis), which is characterized by the InTrack offset Δ𝑦 𝑐 . This\nparameter is the distance between the crossing nodes of two ellipses which are the points of the ellipse\nwith a null CrossTrack (Figure 5.9). The two reference ellipses that define Δ𝑦 𝑐 are the most positive one\n(which is the one with the SE centre with the highest InTrack value) and the most negative one (which is the\none with the SE centre with the lowest InTrack value).\n\n_Figure 5.10: Walking Safety Ellipse geometry_\n\nbetween SROC and SR. These two parameters are related by the following equation:\n\n𝑅= [Δ𝑦] [𝑐]\n\n2 [+ 2𝑥] [𝑚𝑎𝑥]\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\nThe equations used to approximate in the RIC reference frame the SROC motion along the WSE are shown\nbelow:\n\n𝑥(𝜒) = 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜒) − [2𝑦̇] 3𝑛 [𝑐]\n\n𝑦(𝜒) = 2𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜒) +\n\n𝑦̇ 𝑐 (𝜒− [𝜋] 2\n\n+ 𝑦 𝑐\n𝑛\n\n[𝜋]\n\n2 [)]\n\n𝑧(𝜒) = 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜒)\n𝑥̇(𝜒) = 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜒)\n𝑦̇(𝜒) = −2𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜒) −𝑦̇ 𝑐\n\n𝑧̇(𝜒) = −𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜒)\n\nWhere 𝑛 is the mean motion of the primary spacecraft. These equations show that SROC motion depends\non 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝜒 and two additional parameters:\n\n - 𝑦 𝑐 : it is the InTrack distance of the crossing nodes of the initial SE;\n\n - 𝑦̇ 𝑐 : it is the initial velocity of the SE along the InTrack direction;\n\nThe final parameter on which the WSE depends is the desired duration of the inspection. The way that the\nMatlab function defines the WSE is the following:\n\n - 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 are defined by the user; they must be an adequate compromise between the\nmaximum payload range and the constraint to not enter SR’s KOZ;\n\n - The duration of the inspection and Δ𝑦 𝑐 are also user-defined;\n\n - 𝑦 𝑐 and 𝑦̇ 𝑐 are evaluated by the Matlab function through an iterative process until a valid WSE is\nfounded. To be considered valid, a WSE must respect the following constraints:\n\nΔ𝑦 𝑐\n\n`o` 𝑦 𝑐,𝑚𝑎𝑥 <\n\nΔ𝑦 𝑐\n\n𝑐\n\n2 [ and ] [𝑦] [𝑐,𝑚𝑖𝑛] [> −]\n\n`o` 𝑦 𝑐,𝑚𝑎𝑥 2 [𝑦] [𝑐,𝑚𝑖𝑛] 2 [; ]\n\n`o` SROC trajectory never enters the KOZ during the OPA rendezvous, the observation and the\n\nfree flight;\n\n - Once 𝑦 𝑐 and 𝑦̇ 𝑐 have been calculated, it is possible to define the insertion point of the WSE: this\nposition is set as the desired result of the OPA Rendezvous target sequence. The desired velocity in\nRIC components is also evaluated and set as the desired result for the WSE Insertion target\n\nsequence;", "char_len": 5384}

Further studies and\nimprovements shall be implemented to increase accuracy and evaluate the effects of the disturbances on\nthe WSE. This could be done by analytically evaluating the acceleration caused by the disturbances and\ntherefore calculating the actual trajectory of SROC during the motion. Another option may be using STK’s\npre-built proximity operations manoeuvres. The analysis presented in the next sub-section was still useful to\ndefine a reasonable deltaV guess for both the OPA and the WSE Insertion, as well as giving a first\napproximation of the illumination condition of SR during the observation and a solid analysis of the ground\nstation visibility during the free flight phase after the observation.\n\n5.3.2 DoE Results\n\nA DoE was conducted to select an optimal WSE. But to decide which WSE is the best, it was necessary to\ndefine a set of constraints or parameters to minimize/maximize:\n\n - **Payload maximum range** : this value was temporarily set to 200 m in the previous study. However,\nsince then SR’s KOZ has been updated to 200 m, thus making it impossible to respect both\nconstraints. Since the work performed for this thesis concerns Phase B2, an updated value for the\npayload maximum range was not available. For this reason, the intervals during which SR is visible\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\nby the payload have been calculated considering three possible maximum ranges: 250-300-350 m\n(although the values most close to the actual payload requirements should be the first one);\n\n **Minimum actual observation time** : how much time during the observation SR in the payload range;\nsince a minimum value had not been defined, it was selected the WSE with the highest actual\nobservation time;\n\n **Minimum duration of the single observation** : although the total time may be enough, it could be\nobtained by considering periods too short to produce useful data. However, from the analysis of the\nWSEs from the DoE, it was noticed that the shortest interval was lasting 165 seconds, which was\nconsidered more than sufficient for the payload to take pictures of SR;\n\nAs mentioned before, the Matlab function requires the user to define the following parameters: duration of\nthe observation, Δ𝑦 𝑐, 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 . Several combinations of sets of these values were tested, and their\nresults were evaluated in terms of: deltaV required for both the OPA rendezvous and the WSE Insertion,\nduration of the FreeFlight and duration of the actual observation (reported both in hours and percentage of\nthe whole observation segment).\n\nEvery set of values for each variable was selected considering the ones used for the WSE DoE in phase B1,\n\nwhich selected a WSE with:\n\n - Δ𝑦 𝑐 = 400 𝑚 ;\n\n - 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 6 ℎ𝑟 ;\n\n - 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 150 𝑚;\n\n - 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 150 𝑚 ;\n\nFor this analysis, higher 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 were considered because the radio of KOZ was increased to 200 m;\nsince the phase B1 analysis stated that only for a small percentage of the observation SR was in the payload\nrange, a higher duration was considered to increase the total actual observation time.\n\n_Table 5.3: WSE DoE DeltaVs_\n\n|Col1|Col2|𝒙, 𝒛 [m]<br>𝒎𝒂𝒙 𝒎𝒂𝒙|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|𝚫𝒚𝒄** [m]**|**Duration [hr]**|**250-200**|**250-250**|**DeltaV [m/s]**|\n|300|6|0.485|0.559|0.559|\n|300|8|0.485|0.558|0.558|\n|400|6|0.496|0.5689|0.5689|\n|400|8|0.491|0.549|0.549|\n|600|6|0.459|0.515|0.515|\n|600|8|0.459|0.515|0.515|\n\n_Table 5.4: WSE DoE FreeFlight Duration_\n\n|Col1|Col2|𝒙, 𝒛 [m]<br>𝒎𝒂𝒙 𝒎𝒂𝒙|Col4|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|𝚫𝒚𝒄** [m]**|**Duration [hr]**|**250-200**|**250-250**|**FreeFlight Duration**<br>**[hr]**|\n|300|6|8.746|8.745|8.745|\n|300|8|6.777|6.776|6.776|\n|400|6|8.902|8.898|8.898|\n|400|8|6.754|4.96|4.96|\n|600|6|10.062|10.061|10.061|\n|600|8|8.062|8.061|8.061|\n\nin green. The only difference between the two solutions is the duration of the observation phase, while the\ngeometrical parameters of the WSEs are the same. The reason why they have the same deltaV is that they\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\nare the same WSE: they start at the same relative position from SR and with the same initial relative\nvelocity, but the first one just ends the observation phase two hours before. This is also confirmed by the\nduration of their free flight segments (Table 5.4): since they are the same WSE, they take the same total\ntime to perform the observation and propagate during the free flight to the maximum range stopping\ncondition. In fact, the total duration of both solutions is 18.062 hours, the only thing that separates them is\nthe decision to stop performing observations and start the downlink of the data.\n\n_Figure 5.11:RIC components as functions of the time for the two highlighted WSE (6 hr on the left and 8 hours on the right)_\n\n_Table 5.5: Total duration of the actual observation [hr]_\n\n|Col1|Col2|Col3|𝒙, 𝒛 [m]<br>𝒎𝒂𝒙 𝒎𝒂𝒙|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|𝚫𝒚𝒄** [m]**|**Max Range [m]**|**Duration [hr]**|**250-200**|**250-250**|**Actual Observaton Duration [hr]**|\n|300|250|6|0.3792|0.2622|0.2622|\n|300|250|8|0.6176|0.4696|0.4696|\n|300|300|6|1.5036|1.377|1.377|\n|300|300|8|2.1088|1.9352|1.9352|\n|300|350|6|2.2974|2.1144|2.1144|\n|300|350|8|3.2096|2.9472|2.9472|\n|400|250|6|0.4584|0.3138|0.3138|\n|400|250|8|0.5136|0.408|0.408|\n|400|300|6|1.641|1.431|1.431|\n|400|300|8|2.0344|1.9464|1.9464|\n|400|350|6|2.664|2.289|2.289|\n|400|350|8|3.0944|2.7936|2.7936|\n|600|250|6|0.555|0.3552|0.3552|\n|600|250|8|0.6472|0.4384|0.4384|\n|600|300|6|1.7712|1.5312|1.5312|\n|600|300|8|2.1424|1.8616|1.8616|\n|600|350|6|2.7888|2.4306|2.4306|\n|600|350|8|3.3752|2.9656|2.9656|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Table 5.6: Total duration of the actual observa", "char_len": 6000}

Figure 5.11 shows the RIC components of the two highlighted WSE: it is possible to see that\nfor the first 6 hours, they have the same components. Table 5.5 and Table 5.6 show the actual observation\nduration for each of the three maximum payload ranges considered and highlight the highest. As expected,\nthe actual duration of the observation is higher for the WSE lasting 8 hours than for the ones lasting 6\nhours; however, the percentage of the actual observation duration with respect to the total duration is\noften lower for the WSE lasting 8 hours. This can be explained by looking at the trajectory of SROC during\nthese WSEs: for example, Figure 5.11 shows that SROC starts the observation with a slightly negative\nInTrack, then the trajectory moves to the more negative InTrack until, because of the effect of the\natmospheric drag, SROC starts moving towards positive InTrack. For a portion of the 8-hour case, SROC is in\nthe most negative SE, therefore it has a very short interval during which it can observe SR.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\ni\n\n_Figure 5.12: Range as function of the time for the WSE with the longest actual observation duration_\n\nthis WSE, SROC can take pictures of SR during seven intervals, with the shortest one lasting 162 seconds; it\nis noticed that, in accordance with what has been said in the last paragraph, by increasing the length of the\nobservation from 6 hr to 8 hr, only a small interval (approximately 6 minutes) is added to the actual\nobservation duration.\n\n5.3.3 Nominal Observaton Cycle i\n\nFrom the results presented in the last sub-section, the WSE with the lowest deltaV and also the highest\nactual observation duration is obtained by giving the following inputs to the Matlab function:\n\n - Δ𝑦 𝑐 = 600 𝑚 ;\n\n - 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 250 𝑚 ;\n\n - 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 = 200 𝑚 ;\n\n - 𝐷𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛= 8 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑠 ;\n\nThe visibility of SR during the observation was analysed using SRK’s tools Analysis Workbench and Access. A\nsensor object was attached to SROC, and it was set to always points toward SR, thus simulating the\ncamera(s) pointing to SR. The visibility, which STK evaluates as access, of the spacecraft from the sensor was\nconstrained as follows:\n\n - Maximum range between SROC and SR: 250 m;\n\n LOS illumination angle less than 60 deg;\n\n - SR is in sunlight;\n\nless than 250 m (in blue) are the same shown in Figure 5.12, while SR is in sunlight for intervals (in green)\nlasting 56 minutes divided by 36 minutes long umbra periods. The LOS illumination angle condition is always\nrespected (in red): as shown in Figure 5.14 during the observation the maximum angle reached is 54.29\ndegrees.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 5.13: Satisfaction interval for every constraint_\n\n_Figure 5.14: LOS illumination angle during the observation phase_\n\nBy applying all the constraints, the intervals suitable to perform observation of SR are only three and they\nlast for a total of 915 seconds (Table 5.7). Although the length of each interval should be enough to take\npictures of SR, the total duration of the actual observation may not be enough to perform a satisfying\nobservation of SR. This problem could be solved by setting the duration of the HP2 in a way that makes the\nmoments when SR is in the payload range with the sunlight interval. For example, Figure 5.15 and Table 5.8\nshows how the total observation time increases when the HP is performed after 4.3 hours; however, due to\nthe complex nature of the motion it is difficult to predict how performing the observation at a different\nmoment will affect the LOS illumination angle. As said at the beginning the DoE description, for further\nanalyses it will be necessary to increase the accuracy of the WSE definition by evaluating the effects of the\ndisturbances on the WSE. By doing so, it should be obtained a more “stable” WSE, such that it varies very\nlittle from the input geometrical parameters. Moreover, with a more stable function for the WSE definition,\nit could be possible to reduce the 𝑥 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝑧 𝑚𝑎𝑥 without risking the intersection of the WSE with the KOZ.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Table 5.7: Suitable observation intervals_\n\n|Access|Start Time (UTCG)|Stop Time (UTCG)|Duration (sec)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|12 Nov 2024 13:46:10.830|12 Nov 2024 13:49:54.735|223.905|\n|2|12 Nov 2024 15:17:18.207|12 Nov 2024 15:23:09.336|351.128|\n|3|12 Nov 2024 16:52:39.080|12 Nov 2024 16:58:18.928|339.848|\n|Mean Duraton|-|-|304.960|\n|Total Duraton|-|-|914.881|\n\n_Figure 5.15: Satisfaction interval for every constraint with a different HP2 duration_\n\n_Table 5.8: Suitable observation intervals with a different HP2 duration_\n\n|Access|Start Time (UTCG)|Stop Time (UTCG)|Duration (sec)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|12 Nov 2024 09:09:43.225|12 Nov 2024 09:15:12.745|329.520|\n|2|12 Nov 2024 09:40:03.117|12 Nov 2024 09:42:45.466|162.349|\n|3|12 Nov 2024 13:36:29.278|12 Nov 2024 13:39:48.232|198.955|\n|4|12 Nov 2024 15:08:27.998|12 Nov 2024 15:13:44.707|316.709|\n|5|12 Nov 2024 16:44:11.199|12 Nov 2024 16:49:49.577|338.378|\n|Mean Duraton|-|-|269.", "char_len": 6000}

In fact, there is a\nportion at the beginning of the free flight when SROC still respects all the observation constraints: to\nconsider this interval the observation phase was increased from 28800 seconds to 39737 seconds. Figure\n5.17 and Table 5.10 show a great increase in the total suitable observation interval, while Table 5.11 shows\nthat there is still a considerable amount of time to downlink the mission data (1.036 hours).\n\n_Table 5.10: Suitable observation intervals with a longer observation phase_\n\n|Access|Start Time (UTCG)|Stop Time (UTCG)|Duration (sec)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|12 Nov 2024 13:46:10.830|12 Nov 2024 13:49:54.735|223.905|\n|2|12 Nov 2024 15:17:18.208|12 Nov 2024 15:23:09.336|351.128|\n|3|12 Nov 2024 16:52:39.081|12 Nov 2024 16:58:18.929|339.848|\n|4|12 Nov 2024 18:30:54.677|12 Nov 2024 18:36:12.639|317.961|\n|5|12 Nov 2024 20:12:34.937|12 Nov 2024 20:28:56.278|981.342|\n|Mean Duraton|-|-|442.837|\n|Total Duraton|-|-|2214.184|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 5.17: Satisfaction interval for every constraint considering a longer observation sub-phase_\n\n_Table 5.11: Summary of the access analysis during the free flight considering a longer observation sub-phase_\n\n|Results|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Minimum Duraton|233 sec|\n|Maximum Duraton|394 sec|\n|Mean Duraton|339 sec|\n|Total Duraton|3731 sec|\n|Percentage of the free fight|20.63%|\n\nSince this is a Phase B2 study, this work was carried out before the other mission actors perform new\niterations on their respective work. For example, the payload was initially studied to take pictures from a\nmaximum range of 200 m: since the KOZ was updated from 150 to 200m, a new study is required to assess\nthe capability of the camera at higher ranges. For this reason, assessing if the actual observation intervals\nare enough to take a sufficient number of useful pictures is not possible at the moment; however this study\nconstitutes a solid base to help understand the different constraints during the observation sub-phase and,\nin case it is changed during future project iterations, the constraints and analysis tools defined in STK for\nthis DoE will still be useful to rapidly assess the feasibility of the new design.\n\nIn conclusion, the WSE presented at the beginning of the sub-section was selected for the nominal scenario.\nThe two alternative options to increase the actual observation time have not been considered since, as\nexplained before, is not possible to define minimum observation requirements, so it is not possible to select\none option instead of the other. Moreover, picking one of the other two solutions would not significantly\naffect the results of this thesis, which are the deltaV budgets of the nominal and variant scenarios. In fact,\nchanging the duration of the HP2 would slightly modify an already low deltaV contribution to the total\ndeltaV budget, while the second option would not even modify it since it just postpones the switch from the\nobservation to the free flight. To consider the many uncertainties linked to the analysis of the WSE, the\nmargin on its deltaV was increased and the use of a second observation cycle was considered in the variant\nanalysis (Chapter 6).\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 5_ _Nominal Scenarios Analysis_", "char_len": 4328}

The results of these simulations were used to define the\ndeltaV budget and the time budget. The DeltaV budget is fundamental to evaluate if the mission is feasible\nor if some of its aspect need to be modified to be less deltaV-consuming. As stated in requirement SROCMIS-060: “The ΔV for all SROC manoeuvres shall be less than 20 (TBC) m/s including margins”, so it is vital\nfor the mission to stay below the 20 m/s threshold. The time budget, instead, was not compiled to verify\nthe compliance with a specific requirement, since there is none; indicatively, it was decided to set a\nmaximum total duration of 30 days since the total duration of SR’s mission is two months. This information\nwill be useful in the future phases of the design when it will be clearer at which moment of its orbital\noperations SR will deploy SROC and it will be necessary to coordinate SROC’s operations with SR’s.\n\nthe table refer to the manoeuvres which could be performed around a virtual point during HP1. Both, as\nwell as the SR Collision Avoidance Manoeuvre (CAM) were evaluated using different software and\nprocesses, therefore they are not part of this thesis. The Debris CAM (D CAM) was evaluated using the\nsoftware DRAMA, whose analysis and results are described in Chapter 7. It is noted that the margin\nphilosophy used in this study for the deltaV is the one recommended by ESA and reported in the ECSS [27].\n\n\n_Table 5.12: DeltaV budget for the nominal observe scenario_\n\n|OBSERVE<br>Nominal Scenario|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|**Manoeuvre**|**∆V [m/s]**|**Margin**|**∆V [m/s]**|\n|HP1|0.489|5%|0.513|\n|Virtual CAM + HP1 bis|1.040|100%|2.080|\n|Virtual CAM + HP1 ter|0.500|100%|1.000|\n|IPA|0.485|5%|0.509|\n|HP2Ins|1.280|5%|1.344|\n|ZRV2|0.423|5%|0.444|\n|HP2|0.096|5%|0.101|\n|OPA - Cycle 1|0.266|100%|0.532|\n|WSE Insertion - Cycle 1|0.192|100%|0.385|\n|OPA - Cycle 2|0.000|100%|0.000|\n|WSE Insertion - Cycle 2|0.000|100%|0.000|\n|D CAM|0.068|100%|0.136|\n|SR CAM|0.600|5%|0.630|\n|**∆V TOT [m/s]**|**5.439**|**∆V TOT with**<br>**margins [m/s]**|**7.674**|\n\nuntil the end of the POP, since the successive phase (EMP) does not require any coordination with SR’s\nmission.

The variant events considered in this study can be divided into two categories:\n\n\n Programmatic: they take into consideration that some design features of several mission phases are\nyet to be confirmed and that they could change in future design iterations. For example, as\nmentioned in Sub-ection 5.3.2, it may be considered necessary to perform two inspections to\nsuccessfully observe SR;\n\n Operative: during SROC’s operations, variant events could modify the execution of one or more\nphases. For example, a fault of the RF link establishment during the Commissioning Phase may\nincrease its duration. Other variant scenarios caused by a thruster error in the direction or the\nmagnitude of the thrust, have not been evaluated, since they were already considered in a Phase\nB1 study;\n\n\nHP2 was considered as a discontinuity point, after which no previous variant events affect the successive\nones. For this reason, the analysis, and this document too, has been divided as follows:\n\n\n Variant events before HP2 (Section 6.1);\n\n Variant events from HP2 onwards (Section 6.2); they also include a variant EMP: as it is explained in\nSub-section 6.2.2, according to an STK simulation, SROC will not approach SR in its proximity after\nthe POP.

The Matlab functions, after analysing a segment\ncontaining a manoeuvre, obtain a set of possible solutions to reach the desired results, and, for the nominal\nscenario, they set as nominal the manoeuvre which minimizes the deltaV. For this reason, the nominal\nscenarios only have one solution, which is the one minimizing the deltaV, which is referred to as the deltaVdown solution. However, during the analysis of the variant scenario, it came clear that it could have been\nuseful, for the successive design iteration, to also have a set of time-down solutions, which aim at\ndecreasing the duration of the mission, while also maintaining an acceptable deltaV budget.\n\nThis goal was particularly difficult for the variant scenario with a longer commissioning, where three\nalternative solutions to the standard time-down were considered (see Sub-section 6.1.2)\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 6.1: Pre-HP2 variant scenarios_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n6.1.1 Longer HP1\n\nFor this variant scenario, it was considered a longer HP1, from 4.5 hours to 13.5 hours. From the results\nreported in Table 6.1, the deltaV required to perform the HP1 does not change. This is due to how the HP1\nmanoeuvre has been defined: as mentioned before the target sequence of HP1 does not target a specific\nrelative position, rather it sets SROC’s semi-major axis to be the same as SR’s. This desired value is reached\nwith the same manoeuvre as the nominal scenario, the only difference is that SROC propagates for a longer\ntime. As shown in Figure 6.2, this causes SROC to reach a further final relative position: -11.3 km along the\nRadial direction (instead of -10.9 km) and 377 km along the InTrack direction (instead of 373 km).\n\n_Figure 6.2: HP1 trajectory in RIC coordinates for a longer commissioning_\n\nThe different relative position reached by SROC affects the successive segments: as shown in Table 6.1, the\ndeltaV-down solution requires a higher deltaV with respect to the nominal scenario, while the duration of\nthe segments after the HP1 does not change. Although a 9-hour delay does not have a huge influence on\nthe total duration of the mission, a time-down solution was still analysed to recover part of the 9 hours lost\nin HP1. This was achieved by decreasing the duration of the IPA by 7 hours and 41 minutes, but at the cost\nof a higher deltaV. Table 6.2 summarizes the properties of this time-down solution and compares them to\nthe ones of the nominal Observe&Retrieve scenario. This comparison table, as well as the successive ones,\ndoes not include safety margins; they are considered in the summary in Section 6.3.\n\n_Table 6.1: DeltaV and duration comparison between the nominal and the LongHP1 - DeltaV-Down (DD) scenarios_\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [m/s]|Col3|LongHP1 (DD)<br>[m/s]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|-|-|-|-|\n|HP1|0.489|0.489|0.489|0.489|\n|IPA|0.485|2.188|0.518|2.405|\n|HP2Ins|1.280|1.280|1.495|1.495|\n|ZRV2|0.423|0.423|0.392|0.392|\n|Tot PreHP2|2.677|2.677|2.894|2.894|\n|Tot Mission|7.092|7.092|7.309|7.309|\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [day]|Col3|LongHP1 (DD)<br>[day]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|5.000|5.000|5.000|5.000|\n|HP1|0.188|0.188|0.563|0.563|\n|IPA|5.760|5.843|5.760|5.843|\n|HP2Ins|0.083|0.083|0.083|0.083|\n|ZRV2|-|-|-|-|\n|Tot PreHP2|11.031|11.031|11.406|11.406|\n|Tot Mission|12.361|12.361|12.736|12.736|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Table 6.2: DeltaV and duration comparison between the nominal and the LongHP1 - Time-down (TD) scenarios_\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [day]|Col3|LongHP1 (TD)<br>[day]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|5.000|5.000|5.000|5.000|\n|HP1|0.188|0.188|0.563|0.563|\n|IPA|5.760|5.843|5.440|5.523|\n|HP2Ins|0.083|0.083|0.083|0.083|\n|ZRV2|-|-|-|-|\n|Total<br>PreHP2|11.031|11.031|11.086|11.086|\n|Total<br>Mission|12.361|12.361|12.416|12.416|\n\n6.1.2 Longer Commissioning Phase\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [m/s]|Col3|LongHP1 (TD)<br>[m/s]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|-|-|-|-|\n|HP1|0.489|0.489|0.489|0.489|\n|IPA|0.485|2.188|0.521|2.480|\n|HP2Ins|1.280|1.280|1.617|1.617|\n|ZRV2|0.423|0.423|0.343|0.343|\n|Total PreHP2|2.677|2.677|2.969|2.969|\n|Total<br>Mission<br>|7.092|7.092|7.383|7.383|\n\nThe second variant scenario considers a longer HP1: from 5 days to 10 days. Increasing the duration of the\ncommissioning poses two main problems:\n\n The final relative position of SROC at the end of this phase greatly increases because of the\natmospheric drag, which acts for a longer time, further distancing the satellite from SR. As shown in\n\n`o` Radial: -118.44 km\n\n`o` InTrack: 1264.49 km\n\n`o` CrossTrack: -0.13 km\nIt is noted that the RIC reference system starts losing its meaning at such a high relative position. In\nfact, it is not respected one of the assumptions at the base of this relative reference system, which\nis that the relative position vector magnitude must be small if compared to the chief position vector\nmagnitude. A good parameter to compare this final relative position with the one obtained with the\nnominal duration of the commissioning is the range: about 1270 km for the first case and 373 km\nfor the latter.\n\n The total duration of the mission almost doubles, not only because of the additional five days\nrequired to complete the commissioning phase, but also because the IPA manoeuvre requires more\ntime to reach the desired target position.\n\n_Figure 6.3: Propagation of a 10-day", "char_len": 6000}

The InTrack position as a function of the time during\nthe optimal IPA is shown in Figure 6.4: as mentioned earlier, the IPA is longer than the nominal case. So, not\nonly SROC loses 5 days because of the different commissioning, but also requires approximately 6 days\nmore to execute the IPA.\n\ni\n\n_Figure 6.4: InTrack position as function of the time during the IPA - LongComm (DD)_\n\nincreases, although only by approximately 1.2 m/s, since a deltaV solution was applied. This increase is\nmainly due to the higher deltaV required to perform the IPA: the required value is 81% higher than the\nnominal one. Another interesting observation is that the deltaV of the HP1 changes with respect to the\nnominal scenario, although its duration is the nominal one (4.5 hours). This is caused by the decrease of\nSROC’s semi-major axis: since it drifts for more days, the drag decreases its height more than the nominal\ncase. So, it is required a bigger impulse to guarantee a bigger increase in the semi-major axis. The shape of\nSROC’s trajectory during the HP1 changes too, but as shown in Figure 6.5, SROC still rotates around a\nfictitious point without varying its InTrack position of more than 4 km.\n\n_Table 6.3: DeltaV and duration comparison between the nominal and the LongComm – DeltaV-Down (DD) scenarios_\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [m/s]|Col3|LongHP1 (DD)<br>[m/s]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|-|-|-|-|\n|HP1|0.489|0.489|0.887|0.887|\n|IPA|0.485|2.188|0.879|2.943|\n|HP2Ins|1.280|1.280|1.474|1.474|\n|ZRV2|0.423|0.423|0.590|0.590|\n|Total<br>PreHP2|2.677|2.677|3.830|3.830|\n|Total<br>Mission|7.092|7.092|8.245|8.245|\n\ni\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [day]|Col3|LongHP1 (DD)<br>[day]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|5.000|5.000|10.000|10.000|\n|HP1|0.188|0.188|0.188|0.188|\n|IPA|5.760|5.843|11.400|11.483|\n|HP2Ins|0.083|0.083|0.083|0.083|\n|ZRV2|-|-|-|-|\n|Total<br>PreHP2|11.031|11.031|21.671|21.671|\n|Total<br>Mission|12.361|12.361|23.001|23.001|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\ni\n\n_Figure 6.5: SROC Trajectory during HP1 - LongComm (DD)_\n\n6.1.2.2 Time - Down Soluton i\n\nThe worrying increase of the total duration of the mission made necessary the study of a time-down\nsolution.\n\n_Table 6.4: DeltaV and duration comparison between the nominal and the LongComm - Time-Down (TD) scenarios_\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [day]|Col3|LongHP1 (TD)<br>[day]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|5.000|5.000|10.000|10.000|\n|HP1|0.188|0.188|0.188|0.188|\n|IPA|5.760|5.843|10.820|10.903|\n|HP2Ins|0.083|0.083|0.083|0.083|\n|ZRV2|-|-|-|-|\n|Total<br>PreHP2|11.031|11.031|21.091|21.091|\n|Total<br>Mission|12.361|12.361|22.421|22.421|\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [m/s]|Col3|LongHP1 (DD)<br>[m/s]|Col5|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|-|-|-|-|\n|HP1|0.489|0.489|0.887|0.887|\n|IPA|0.485|2.188|0.881|3.107|\n|HP2Ins|1.280|1.280|1.679|1.679|\n|ZRV2|0.423|0.423|0.547|0.547|\n|Total<br>PreHP2|2.677|2.677|3.994|3.994|\n|Total<br>Mission|7.092|7.092|8.409|8.409|\n\ni\n\nThe total duration obtained with this solution was not as low as hoped: as shown in Table 6.4, the total\nduration obtained is just 14 hours less than the deltaV one. As explained in Section 4.2, at the end of the IPA\nthe trajectory of SROC is propagated for 24 hours to assess the risk to SR in case no manoeuvre is\nperformed in the successive 24 hours. The IPA optimization functions only considered an IPA valid if it does\nnot cross 200 m along the InTrack direction during this propagation. The solutions which would decrease\nthe duration of the IPA are also the ones that would result in a higher relative velocity at the end of the IPA,\nwhich would cause them to cross the 200 m InTrack limit in the successive 24-hour propagations.\n\nFor this reason, alternative solutions to reduce the time were considered:\n\n Alternative Time-down 1 (ATD-1): run the same Matlab function, but without considering the 24hours propagation after the IPA;\n\n Divide the IPA into two parts: during the first one, it is performed the TD1. However, instead of\npropagating until the desired relative position is reached, the satellite performs a second\nmanoeuvre during the propagation. This additional manoeuvre aims at respecting the 24-hours\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\npropagation constraint by reducing the relative velocity of SROC. Two possible starting points for\nthe IPA Brake were considered:\n\n`o` Alternative Time-down 2 (ATD-2): the braking manoeuvre is performed 24 hours before the\n\nend of the TD1;\n`o` Alternative Time-down 3 (ATD-3) the braking manoeuvre is performed 12 hours before the\n\nend of the TD1;\nBy doing so, it may be recovered some time by the first part of the IPA, which is faster, while the\nsecond part should guarantee a manoeuvre safe enough.\n\nthe ATD-2 and ATD-3, it is important to not confuse the interval of time which is subtracted to the ATD-1\n(that is 24 or 12 hours) with the actual duration of the IPA after the brake, which is longer since the relative\nmotion towards SR has been decreased.\n\ni i\n\n_Figure 6.6: Alternative time-down solutions comparison and definition_\n\n6.1.2.3 Alternatve Time i - Down Solutons i – ATD - 1\n\ni i\n\n_Figure 6.7: 3D plot of the total deltaV as function of the total duration and the IPA InTrack target – ATD-1_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\nthe circles refer to one analysed sequence).

For this reason, the final\nsolution has been\nof the duration of the IPA. As expected, the IPA’s deltaV trend decreases with its duration: this can be\nexplained by considering that the fastest the IPA is, the higher variation in the kinetic energy is required.\nThe behaviour for the total deltaV, instead, is a bit different: although the trend of the solutions decreases\nwith the duration of the IPA, the single solutions do not. This discrepancy with the IPA’s deltaV is caused by\nthe deltaV contribution of the HP2 insertion and ZRV2 manoeuvres.\n\nDifferent combinations of durations and InTrack targets define a different set of relative positions and\nvelocities at the end of the IPA, thus influencing the required deltaV for the successive manoeuvres. This\nmeans that small differences in the selection of the moment to end the IPA and start the HP2 insertion (in\nthe order of tens of minutes) can change the cost of the HP2 insertion and subsequent ZRV2 manoeuvre. Of\ncourse, to consider this factor, it should be used smaller steps for the IPA InTrack target and IPA duration\nthan the ones considered for this analysis. However, this change was not applied because it would have\nincreased considerably the analysis time required by the Matlab functions. Moreover, this approach gives a\nmore conservative estimate of the required deltaV, since, in case an ulterior optimization was required, the\nallocated total deltaV could only decrease with respect to the current results. Finally, to consider the\noptimal moment to end the IPA with precision in the order of minutes it would be necessary to assess if the\nactual manoeuvre could be performed with the same precision during the operative phase.

A new Matlab function, called “IPA_Brake” was\ncreated to evaluate the ATD-2 and the ATD-3 solutions. To define the ATD-1 solution the same Matlab\nfunction described in Section 4.2 is used, with the only difference being that the hypothetical 24-hour\npropagation at the end of the IPA and the relative InTrack check are not performed. At the end of this\nanalysis, if a specific flag defined by the user in the JSON of the IPA optimization function is true, the\n“IPA_Brake” function is called. In short, this is the analysis process performed by this new function:\n\n Change the duration of the IPA propagation: as mentioned before, the braking manoeuvre is\ndefined starting from the point of the IPA propagation at 24 (for the ATD-2) and 12 (for the ATD-3)\nhours from the end of the propagation itself; the MCS on STK is than run to apply these changes;\n\n - Add to STK the IPA_Brake target sequence, which is composed of the same segments as the IPA\nRendezvous target sequence:\n\n`o` Manoeuvre segment to perform the braking manoeuvre;\n`o` Propagation segment to propagate SROC to the desired InTrack position;\nThis sequence also has the same desired result (the InTrack position at the end of the propagation)\nand the same control parameter (the thrust vector along the V axis of SROC’s VNC reference\nsystem);\n\n Define the optimal brake manoeuvre in terms of the total deltaV required by the IPA brake + HP2\ninsertion + ZRV2 manoeuvres. This process is performed exactly as the one for the nominal\nscenario:\n\n`o` Different solutions obtained by iterating on the duration and the InTrack target are\n\nanalysed. In this case, the IPA duration does not refer to the whole IPA, but only to the\nbraked part, that is the propagate segment after the IPA brake;\n`o` If they are valid, the successive HP2 insertion and ZRV2 manoeuvres are evaluated. The\n\nconstraints used to define the validity of the braked section of the IPA are the same used for\nthe nominal scenario analysis. Of course, since the aim of the ATD-2 and ATD-3 solutions is\nto provide a safer solution than the ATD-1, they include the 200 m InTrack limit after a 24hours propagation at the end of the IPA;\n`o` All the valid solutions are saved to be post-processed;\n\ni i\n\n_Figure 6.10: 3D plot of the total deltaV as function of the total duration and the IPA InTrack target – ATD-2_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\nsolution; the “total” adjective in the legend refers to the IPA brake + HP2 insertion and ZRV2 manoeuvres.\nThese results were obtained by iterating on the following values for the IPA_Brake target sequence:\n\n - InTrack target: [3:0.5: 7] km;\n\n Duration: [2:0.1:6] days;", "char_len": 5814}

This means\nthat in case no manoeuvre was performed SROC would cross the 200 km InTrack limit in less than 13 hours.\nIn conclusion, considering the safety constraint, the required deltaV and the duration, the best solution may\nbe the ATD-2 solution.\n\n_Table 6.11: DeltaV comparison between the nominal and all the time-down solutions in case of a longer commissioning_\n\nNominal Scenario - LongComm DeltaV\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal<br>[m/s]|Col3|LongHP1 (TD)<br>[m/s]|Col5|LongHP1<br>(ATD-1) [m/s]|Col7|LongHP1<br>(ATD-2) [m/s]|Col9|LongHP1<br>(ATD-3)<br>[m/s]|Col11|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|HP1|0.489|0.489|0.887|0.887|0.887|0.887|0.887|0.887|0.887|0.887|\n|IPA|0.485|2.188|0.881|3.107|1.664|4.058|2.676|5.843|2.777|5.435|\n|HP2Ins|1.280|1.280|1.679|1.679|2.030|2.030|4.255|4.255|1.851|1.851|\n|ZRV2|0.423|0.423|0.547|0.547|0.364|0.364|0.473|0.473|0.807|0.807|\n|Total<br>PreHP2|2.667|2.667|3.994|3.994|4.945|4.945|8.291|8.291|6.322|6.322|\n|Total<br>Mission|7.092|7.092|8.409|8.409|9.360|9.360|12.706|12.706|10.737|10.737|\n\n6.1.3 Longer Commissioning and HP1\n\nThe third possible deviation from the nominal scenario involves both a longer HP1 (4.5 hours) and\ncommissioning (10 days). The trajectory during HP1 differs from the ones in the previous case, but the\nrequired deltaV to perform the HP1 insertion manoeuvre is the same for the longer commissioning phase.\nThis is the equivalent of what has been said for the longer HP1 deviation: the target of the manoeuvre is to\nget SR’s semi-major axis at the end of the HP1 and this objective is met with the same manoeuvre for a\nduration of both 4.5 and 13.5 hours. The semi-major axis is increased by an impulsive manoeuvre and stays\nalmost constant for the whole HP1 since its duration is not enough for the external disturbances,\nparticularly the atmospheric drag, to change it. Figure 6.15 shows the SROC’s trajectory during HP1.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\ni\n\n_Figure 6.15: SROC’s trajectoty during HP1 for a longer commissioning and HP1_\n\nThe principal problems which arise from this scenario are the same discussed in the previous sub-section.\nFor this reason, the solution investigated are also the same:\n\n - **DeltaV-down** IPA + HP2 insertion + ZRV2 sequence which minimizes the deltaV;\n\n - **Time Down** : IPA + HP2 insertion + ZRV2 sequence which minimizes the duration without breaking\nthe 200 km InTrack constraint on a hypothetical 24-hours propagation after the IPA;\n\n - **Alternative time-down** :\n\n`o` **ATD-1** : no InTrack constraint on a hypothetical 24-hours propagation after the IPA;\n`o` **ATD-2** : solution composed of two parts: during the first one, the same IPA selected for ATD\n1 is performed. The second part is constituted by a braking manoeuvre to slow down SROC\nenough to respect the 200 km InTrack constraint on a hypothetical 24-hours propagation\nafter the IPA. This brake manoeuvre is performed 24 hours before the end of the ATD-1;\n`o` **ATD-3** : it only differs from the ATD-2 for the time at which the brake is performed (12 hours\n\nbefore the ATD-1 end instead of 24 hours);\n\n6.1.3.1 DeltaV - Down Soluton i\n\nsame considerations made for the DD solution in case of longer commissioning can be applied here.\nActually, SROC starts the IPA at an even higher relative distance from Space Rider, since the longer HP1\ncauses SROC to drift a few kilometres more. Since SROC starts the IPA at a higher relative position, it also\nrequires a higher time to perform it in a deltaV-efficient way.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\ni\n\n_Figure ", "char_len": 6000}

As for the previous ATD-1\nanalysed, the adjective “total” refers to the combination of the IPA + HP2 insertion and ZRV2 manoeuvre.\nThese results were obtained by iterating on the following parameters:\n\n - InTrack target: [2:0.5: 7] km;\n\n Duration: [2:0.1:6] days;\n\ni i\n\n_Figure 6.17: 3d plot of the results of the ATD-1 analysis_\n\nThe optimal solution was selected to reduce the total duration while also avoiding increasing too much the\ndeltaV. The red box in Figure 6.18 highlights the set of solutions that were considered for ATD-1: they were\nselected because, although they are approximately 1 day longer than the shortest solutions, they require\nabout 1 m/s less.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 6.18: Optimal solutions – ATD-1_\n\ntarget. As expected, the deltaV cost of the IPA decrease with the increase of its total duration since it\nrequires a longer IPA, thus a lower change of the kinetic energy. The total deltaV cost, although has a\ndecreasing trend, does not show this behaviour for every solution. This is caused by the HP2 insertion and\nZRV2 manoeuvres, whose contribution to the total deltaV has already been analysed in Sub-section 6.1.2.3.\nIt is probable that with a finer step on the duration of both the IPA and the HP2 insertion and of the InTrack\ntarget of the IPA, these deltaV differences could decrease, with the total deltaV progressively decreasing\nwith the IPA duration for all the solutions.\n\n_Figure 6.19: DeltaV trend - ATD-1_\n\ndeltaV of the IPA, duration and deltaV of the HP2 insertion, deltaV for the ZRV2 manoeuvre, total deltaV\nand total duration of the IPA + HP2 insertion + ZRV2 sequence.

This may\nseem counterintuitive since, usually the solutions present a total deltaV trend decreasing with the total\nduration. As reported in Table 6.16, the acceptable solutions are obtained only for a duration of the braked\nsegment of the IPA of 5.8 days, so the differences in the total durations and deltaV are caused by the\ndifferent combinations of IPA InTrack targets and HP2 insertion durations.

The discrepancy between\nthe data reported in the table and the expected behaviour could probably be eliminated by using finer steps\nfor the duration and InTrack target values used for the analysis. However, this would have increased the\nanalysis time too much and it would not have been possible to perform analysis this fine on all the possible\nvariant scenarios.

Generally, the same conclusion made for the longer commissioning analysis can be applied here:\nthe shortest option is the ATD-1, but it is not safe enough. The TD and ATD-2 solution meet the safety\nconstraints of the project; however, they present a higher total duration (respectively 22.816 and 20.176\ndays). The ATD-2 is shorter than 2 days and 15 hours and 22 minutes, however, since it includes an\nadditional manoeuvre to slow down the IPA, it costs 12.811 m/s instead of 9.904 m/s. Finally, the ATD-3\ncould be a good compromise between these two options, since it is even shorter and requires a 10.212 m/s\ndeltaV. However, this manoeuvre is performed 12 hours before the end of the unbraked IPA, which means\nthat if no braking manoeuvre was performed, SROC would cross the 200 m InTrack limit in approximately 13\nhours. For this reason, the solution could be considered not safe enough. The final choice between the TD\nand ATD-2 could be the presence of other variant mission segments: in case any of them increased the total\ndeltaV even more, the additional cost of the ATD-2 could not be worth as much as the time recovered with\nrespect to the TD solution.\n\n_Table 6.19:Duration comparison between the nominal and all the time-down solutions in case of a longer commissioning and HP1_\n\nNominal Scenario - LongComm&HP1 Duration\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal<br>[day]|Col3|LongComm&<br>HP1 (TD) [day]|Col5|LongComm&<br>HP1 (ATD-1)<br>[day]|Col7|LongComm&<br>HP1 (ATD-2)<br>[day]|Col9|LongComm&<br>HP1 (ATD-3)<br>[day]|Col11|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Comm|5.000|5.000|10.000|10.000|10|10|10|10|10.000|10.000|\n|HP1|0.188|0.188|0.563|0.563|0.563|0.563|0.563|0.563|0.563|0.563|\n|IPA|5.760|5.843|10.840|10.923|3.4|3.55|8.2|8.28|6.400|6.483|\n|HP2Ins|0.083|0.083|0.083|0.083|0.146|0.146|0.083|0.083|0.083|0.083|\n|ZRV2|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|Total<br>PreHP2|11.031|11.031|21.486|21.486|14.109|14.109|18.846|18.846|17.046|17.046|\n|Total<br>Mission|12.361|12.361|22.816|22.816|15.439|15.439|20.176|20.176|18.376|18.376|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Table 6.20: DeltaV comparison between the nominal and all the time-down solutions in case of a longer commissioning_\n\nNominal Scenario - LongComm&HP1 DeltaV", "char_len": 3384}

Since\nthe second OPA starts with a different relative position and relative from SR than the first one, it is\nnecessary to evaluate again both the OPA and WSE insertion manoeuvres. The goal of the analysis was to\nset a new inspection phase that was as similar as possible to the first one, so it was selected the following\ninspection:\n\n - Same input geometrical parameters\n\n Similar actual observation time: the number of intervals is the same and their duration is similar,\nalthough the total duration for the second inspection is slightly more (46 minutes in total)\n\n Almost the same duration for the free flight (8.058 hours instead of 8.060 hours)\n\nsecond one presents a higher maximum range, it can be seen that the number of intervals of actual\nobservation, their duration, and the time at which they take place are almost the same.\n\n_Figure 6.27: Comparison between the range as a function of the time for the first (left) and second(right) inspection_\n\nare very close, while the InTrack reaches a lower minimum from the fourth hour of the propagation onward\n(which explains the higher ranges shown in Figure 6.27).\n\n_Figure 6.28: Comparison between the range as a function of the time for the first (left) and second(right) inspection_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\nSince at the end of the second inspection sequence SROC’s relative position and velocity differ from the first\none, the HP3 insertion deltaV and duration may differ from the nominal observe & retrieve scenario. For\nthis reason, the HP3 insertion and ZRV3 were re-evaluated for this different scenario. Figure 6.29 shows\nSROC’s trajectory during the HP3 insertion, while Table 6.21 reports the deltaV and duration of both the\nnominal and this variant scenario. The deltaV cost of the second inspection differs from the first one: the\ncost of the WSE insertion is similar, with the second one requiring 0.029 m/s more, while the deltaV of the\nsecond OPA manoeuvre is significantly lower (0.095 m/s instead of 0.226 m/s). The manoeuvres after the\ninspection phase are identical in duration and very similar in the deltaV cost, probably because both the\nHP3 insertion manoeuvres are performed after similar WSEs and free flight segments.\n\n_Figure 6.29: HP3 insertion after the second inspection cycle_\n\n_Table 6.21: DeltaV and duration comparison between the nominal and the 2 Inspections scenarios_\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [day]|2 Inspections<br>[day]|\n|---|---|---|\n|OPA - Cycle 1|0.167|0.167|\n|Inspection +<br>Free Flight -<br>Cycle 1|0.669|0.669|\n|OPA - Cycle 2|-|0.171|\n|Inspection +<br>Free Flight -<br>Cycle 2|-|0.669|\n|HP3Ins|0.113|0.113|\n|ZRV3|-|-|\n|Total Mission|12.361|13.201|\n\n6.2.2 End of Mission Phase Analysis\n\n|Mission<br>Segment|Nominal [m/s]|2 Inspections<br>[m/s]|\n|---|---|---|\n|OPA - Cycle 1|0.266|0.266|\n|WSE Insertion -<br>Cycle 1|0.192|0.192|\n|OPA - Cycle 2|-|0.095|\n|WSE Insertion -<br>Cycle 2|-|0.221|\n|HP3Ins|0.221|0.208|\n|ZRV3|0.438|0.421|\n|Total Mission<br>|7.092|7.377|\n\nFor the Observe scenario, after the completion of the inspection cycle, SROC is free to drift away from Space\nRider. Since its ballistic coefficient is inferior to Space Rider’s, SROC’s orbit height decreases faster, which\nmeans that its orbital period becomes shorter. This may lead to an unsafe situation where SROC approaches\nSR from behind until a point where SROC InTrack is null; this point will be referred to as Encounter Point (EP)\nfrom here on out. Before proceeding with this analysis, it is reminded that in the STK scenario, SR’s orbit is\ncontrolled, thus the effects of the drag are not considered. At this moment, it is unknown if such a fine orbit\ncontrol will be applied, although it is more probable that SR will not control its semi-major axis for the\nwhole mission, rather it will perform one or more manoeuvre to increase it and restore it to the initial\nvalue. Considering SR continuously controlled is, however, a more conservative approach because it\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\nconsiders the highest difference between SROC and Space Rider’s semi-major axis, which means the highest\ndifference in the two orbital periods, thus the fastest time to get to the EP.\n\nIn the nominal Observe scenario, the orbit SROC orbit was propagated until the EP. Figure 6.30 reports the\nevolution of the SROC’s range as a function of the UTC time: the first relative maximum takes place after the\nend of the HP1. After that, the successive relative minimum happens during the inspection cycle; next,\nSROC’s range increases until it reaches a relative maximum approximately on 29 December 2024. This is the\nmoment when angle 𝜙, which is the difference between the true anomaly of the two spacecrafts, is 180\ndegrees. From that point onwards, the range decreases since 𝜙 increases even more until another relative\nminimum is reached again. Figure 6.31 zooms on all the relative minimums found by the analysis, which\npropagated SROC until May 14 [th] . After the first minimum, the other relative minimums progressively\nincrease because SROC’s semi-major axis is continuously decreased by the atmospheric drag. The time\nintervals between each relative minimum decrease with the time because SROC orbital period increases.\n\n_Figure 6.30: SROC’s range as a function of the time_\n\n_Figure 6.31: SROC’s range as a function of the time - zoom on the minimum ranges_", "char_len": 5713}

It\nis important to notice that the EP takes place on 18 Jan 2025 at 11:20 UTCG which is more than two months\nafter the end of the inspection cycle (13 Nov 2024 at 01:31 UTCG). Considering that the whole SR mission\nshould take a maximum of two months to be completed, at the time of the virtual EP the mission would be\ncompletely over. However, three possible solutions to guarantee a minimum radial separation at the EP (20\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\nkm) or to further delay it were analysed to define the best option deltaV and safety-wise in case more\nassurance is required. Since the EP should not take place during a nominal mission, the results of this\nanalysis were not considered in the nominal scenario.\n\n6.2.2.1 Hohmann Manoeuvre\n\nThe first option envisages a Hohmann manoeuvre shortly after the end of the observation cycle. Its\nobjective is to guarantee a radial separation of 20 km after its completion. To simulate the manouvre the\nfollowing sequence was created:\n\n “ToApogee”: a propagation segment that ends when SROC is at its apogee;\n\n - “Change Radius of Periapsis”: a target sequence that includes a manoeuvre segment followed by a\npropagation one which propagates until SROC reaches its perigee. The control parameters of the\ndifferential corrector are the thrust vectors of the manoeuvre segment, while the objective is\nSROC’s radius of periapsis at the end of the propagation;\n\n - “Circularize”: this target sequence is composed of only a manoeuvre segment which is used to\nreach the desired result of the differential corrector: a null eccentricity;\n\nAfter defining the sequence in STK, it is necessary to set the desired value for the radius of periapsis. Figure\n6.32 shows how the semi-major axis (black), the radius of periapsis (green), the position vector magnitude\n(light blue) and eccentricity (purple) vary for SR. The image considers only two hours of the whole\npropagation time, but the trend is similar for the whole mission. Because of the gravitational field\ndisturbances, the eccentricity of SR varies from 10 [-4] to 3·10 [-3] every orbit. When the satellite is at the apogee\n(red box) the eccentricity is almost null, so the actual position vector magnitude is less than 1 km more than\nthe semi-major axis. Instead, when SR is at the perigee (yellow box), the eccentricity is higher, thus\nobtaining a radius of periapsis equal to 6758.6 km which is sensibly less than the semi-major axis.\n\nThe propagation of both SR and SROC orbits cannot be performed with a precision high enough to\nguarantee that the exact moment at which the EP will actually happen is the same as the simulated one. For\nthis reason, the desired value for SROC’s radius of periapsis was set to 20 km less than the minimum SR’s\nradius of periapsis.\n\n_Figure 6.32: several Keplerian elements during approximately two SR's orbits_\n\nHohmann sequence. The semi-major axis decreases in two different moments: at first, after the radius of\nperiapsis reduction, then, after the orbit is circularized. It can also be seen that the position vector\nmagnitude varies similarly to SR.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 6.33: SROC semi-major axis and position vector magnitude before and after the manoeuvre_\n\nof the curve greatly increases after the completion of the Hohmann manoeuvre since it moves SROC in a\nlower orbit. This causes the EP to take place in less time, on 30 Nov 2024. As shown in Figure 6.35; the\nminimum range is reached at the first EP and it is equal to 32.25 km, while the minimum radial separation is\n24.24 km and it is reached on 13 Dec 2024.\n\n_Figure 6.34: SROC’s range as a function of the time considering the Hohmann manoeuvre_\n\n_Figure 6.35: SROC’s range as a function of the time considering the Hohmann manoeuvre - zoom on the minimum ranges_\n\nThe costs of the two manoeuvres are the following:\n\n - Radius of apoapsis decrease: 5.446 m/s;\n\n Circularization: 16.202 m/s\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\nThe total deltaV is 21.648 m/s which is more than the total maximum deltaV allocated for the mission. In\nconclusion, the Hohmann manoeuvre was considered not feasible for its excessive deltaV cost.\n\n6.2.2.2 CAM near the EP\n\nThe second option is a CAM performed 1 day before the envisaged EP. The goal of the CAM is to set a\nminimum 20 km radial separation between SR and SROC. To achieve this goal the following segments were\nadded after the free flight:\n\n “PropagateToEP”: it is a propagation segment which propagates until SROC reaches the EP; this\ncondition is evaluated in STK as the moment when the satellite crosses SR’s Radial – CrossTrack\nplane;\n\n - “Backward 1 Day”: the type of this segment is backward sequence. All the segments contained\ninside of it are propagated backwards: this means that the initial state is actually the last, in time.\nInside this sequence there is a propagation segment which stop after one day; by doing so, SROC\ntrajectory is propagated to 1 day before the EP;\n\n “CAM”: this segment is a target sequence, which contains a manoeuvre and a propagation that\nstops when the EP is reached. The differential corrector is set to achieve a desired Radial value using\nthe manoeuvre thrust as the control parameter.\n\nSince the minimum acceptable radial separation is 20 km, this value was set as the desired result of the\nCAM target sequence. Figure 6.36 shows that the radial separation is almost 20 km (18.965 km) at the EP.\n\n_Figure 6.36: Radial separation at the EP_", "char_len": 5712}

For this reason, several runs where tested to assess\nthe deltaV cost for different radial separations; the results of this analyses are report in Table 6.22. For\nlower values the deltaV required is compatible with the deltaV available for the mission (3.868 m/s for a 20\nkm radial separation), but for higher values the deltaV is too high: for example, to achieve a 30 km radial\nseparation a 9.717 m/s deltaV is required. Since it is not possible to assess with total accuracy the state of\nthe satellites at the EP, it would make sense to consider a higher radial separation than 20 km. However, as\nreported in the table, this causes the deltaV cost to greatly increase to non-acceptable values.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Table 6.22: DeltaV cost for different radial separation values_\n\n|Radial Separation at the EP [km]|DeltaV cost [m/s]|\n|---|---|\n|15|2.265|\n|20|3.868|\n|25|6.305|\n|30|9.717|\n|40|14.656|\n\n6.2.2.3 Semi - Major Axis Increase Manoeuvre\n\nThe last option evaluated was to perform a semi-major increase manoeuvre to increase the orbital period of\nSROC, thus delaying the EP. For the sake of this analysis, it is not useful to use the RIC reference system to\nmeasure the relative position of SROC, since when the satellite is far away from SR the assumption of small\nrelative position vector magnitude compared to the chief position vector magnitude does not hold up. For\nthis reason, the angle between SROC and SR’s position vectors, called 𝜙, was used as a reference for the\nrelative position between the two satellites. Figure 6.37 shows the angle between SR and SROC’s normal to\nthe orbital plane; since its value is almost close to zero, it can be assumed that the two orbits are co-planar\nand that the angle 𝜙 lays on this plane.\n\n_Figure 6.37: angle between the two orbital planes as a function of the time_\n\nworkbench tool, which evaluates the angle between 0 and 180 degrees, which means that the angle is not\ndefined by any direction. The following STK segments were added to study this manoeuvre:\n\n - “EMPProp1”: it propagates SROC’s trajectory until it is met a user-defined values of 𝜙, which it was\nset to 175 degrees for this analysis;\n\n “SMA Increase”: this target sequence includes a propagation and a manoeuvre segment (in this\norder); the propagation segment stops at the perigee: by performing the successive manoeuvre\nthere, an increase of the apoapsis is obtained. The desired value of the differential corrector is the\nsemi-major axis, and the control parameter is SROC’s trust vector along the velocity direction.\n\n “EMPProp2”: this propagation segment propagates until a user-defined epoch. For this analysis, it\nwas set to more than three months after the end of the free flight (13 Feb 2025 00:00);\n\n “PropToEP”: this propagation segment propagates SROC’s trajectory until the EP;\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\nThese segments are set and run by a Matlab function, which iterates on a vector of user-defined radius of\nsemi-major axis increases and selects the first one valid.; since the vector contains increasing values, the\nfirst valid one is also the less deltaV-consuming. To set the desired values for the differential corrector, the\nanalysed semi-major axis increase is added to the semi-major axis at the epoch of the manoeuvre. To be\nconsidered valid, every iteration must stay above a threshold 𝜙 value (for this analysis it was set to 5\ndegrees) until the end of the “EMPProp2” segment. Finally, the last propagation segment is used to define\nwhen evert valid solution reaches the EP. In conclusion, the Matlab code lets the user investigate which\napoapsis increase manoeuvre guarantees that SROC will stay above a certain 𝜙 values until a desired epoch.\nAnother value that the user can define is the 𝜙 at which the phasing manoeuvre starts; different values\ncould be considered to investigate the best moment to perform a less deltaV-consuming manoeuvre, or to\nstudy other variant scenarios which envisage a specific time window to manoeuvre.\n\n_Figure 6.38:_ 𝜙 _angle_\n\nFor this analysis, the following vector of apoapsis increase values was used: [5:0.01:8] km. The first solution\nwas found at 5.600 km, which increases the semi-major axis to 6777.77 km for a deltaV cost equal to 3.112\nm/s. Figure 6.39 and Figure 6.40 show the evolution of 𝜙 as a function of the time: in the first picture, it can\nbe seen that the rate at which 𝜙 increases is noticeably slowed down after the manoeuvre (highlighted in\nthe red box). Instead, the second picture, which does not consider the semi-major axis increase manoeuvre,\nshows how the 𝜙 rate increases with the time, until the EP is reached on 18 Jan 2025. Instead, by\nperforming the manoeuvre, the EP does not take place until 13 February 2025 23:44 UTCG. Figure 6.41\nshows the range as a function of the time: again, after the semi-major axis increase manoeuvre, the range\nrate decreases. Figure 6.42 zooms on the last hours before the EP, where the range between SROC and SR\nwould only be 12.700 km.\n\nSince the deltaV required is acceptable and the option does not envisage any additional operations in the\nproximity of SR, this option was picked for the variant EMP scenario.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 6.39:_ 𝜙 _as a function of the time if the manoeuvre is performed_\n\n_Figure 6.40:_ 𝜙 _as a function of the time if no manoeuvre is performed_\n\n_Figure 6.41: Range as a function of the time if the manoeuvre is performed_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Figure 6.42: Range as a function of the time - zoom on the final hours before t", "char_len": 6000}

In particular, it is analysed if every variant scenario\npreserves the following nominal properties:\n\n - Total deltaV less than 20 m/s;\n\n Total duration less than 30 days;\n\n IPA safe with respect to SR: this means that after the segment, if no additional manoeuvre is\nperformed, SROC propagates its orbit without getting closer to SR of less than 200 m along the\nInTrack direction for at least 24 hours;\n\nThese three properties have been analysed for every possible MCS; since the total number of all the\npossibilities considered is very high, all the analysed cases have been divided into four tables to simplify\ntheir browsing:\n\n - Table 6.23: refers to all the possible variants for the Observe&Retrieve scenario with a nominal\nduration for both HP2 and HP3;\n\n - Table 6.24: reports the results of all the possible variants for the Observe scenario considering a\nnominal duration for the HP2;\n\n - Table 6.25: reports the results of all the possible variants that present a longer HP2 and HP3 (both\nlasting 13.5 hours instead of 4.5) for the Observe&Retrieve scenario;\n\nhours) for the Observe scenario;\n\nEach row in these tables refers to a different MCS and it is highlighted in two possible colours: green if all\nthe constraints are satisfied, red if at least one of them is not. It is noted that all the Observe scenarios’\nvariant MCSs consider an additional manoeuvre during the EMP and that the values for the deltaV and the\nduration include the margins. It is interesting to notice that all the scenarios considered always respect the\nlimitations on the deltaV cost and the duration, thus showing the robustness of the mission to alternative\nMCSs. Although the ATD-1 and the ATD-3 have been labelled as not safe enough, it is noted that for every\npossible variant event there is at least one acceptable solution. So, even if the ATD-1 and ATD-3 are not safe\nenough, their relative variant MCSs can be approached using other solutions such as the ATD-2, the timedown, or the deltaV-down solutions. In conclusion, all the solutions which did not respect the nominal\nconstraints on duration, deltaV cost and safety, have been labelled as off-nominal.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Table 6.23: Overview for the Observe&Retrieve scenarios_\n\n|Observe and Retrieve – Nominal HP2 & HP3|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|**Scenario**|**DeltaV cost**|**Duration**|**Safe**|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerHP1 (DD)|9.637|13.373|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerHP1 (TD)|9.716|13.037|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerHP1 (DD)<br>2 Insp|10.236|14.076|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerHP1 (TD)<br>2 Insp|11.248|13.740|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (DD)|10.620|24.151|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (TD)|10.792|23.542|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (ATD-1)|11.791|15.542|No|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (ATD-2)|15.304|20.582|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (ATD-3)|13.236|19.426|No|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (DD)<br>2 Insp|12.152|24.854|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (TD)<br>2 Insp|11.391|24.245|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (ATD-1)<br>2 Insp|12.390|16.244|No|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (ATD-2)<br>2 Insp|15.904|21.284|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm (ATD-3)<br>2 Insp|13.836|20.129|No|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(DD)|10.998|24.629|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(TD)|11.177|23.957|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-1)|12.362|16.211|No|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-2)|15.415|21.185|Yes|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-3)|12.685|19.295|No|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(DD)<br>2 Insp|11.597|25.332|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(TD)<br>2 Insp|11.777|24.660|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-1)<br>2 Insp|12.962|16.914|No|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-2)<br>2 Insp|16.014|21.888|Yes|\n|Observe&Retrieve<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-3)<br>2 Insp|13.285|19.998|No|\n\n_Table 6.24: Overview for the Observe scenarios_\n\n|Observe – Nominal HP2|Col2|Col3|Col4|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|**Scenario**|**DeltaV cost**|**Duration**|**Safety**|\n|Observe<br>LongerHP1 (DD)|11.170|13.051|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerHP1 (TD)|10.315|12.715|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerHP1 (DD)<br>2 Insp|11.800|13.753|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerHP1 (TD)<br>2 Insp|11.878|13.417|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (DD)|12.152|23.829|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (TD)|12.325|22.114|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (ATD-1)|13.323|15.219|No|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (ATD-2)|14.165|20.259|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (ATD-3)|14.769|19.104|No|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (DD)<br>2 Insp|12.782|24.532|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (TD)<br>2 Insp|12.955|23.923|Yes|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (ATD-1)<br>2 Insp|13.395|15.922|No|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (ATD-2)<br>2 Insp|17.467|20.962|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm (ATD-3)<br>2 Insp|15.399|19.807|No|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(DD)|12.530|24.307|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(TD)|12.710|23.635|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-1)|13.895|15.889|No|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-2)|16.948|20.863|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-3)|14.218|18.973|No|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(DD)<br>2 Insp|13.160|25.009|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(TD)<br>2 Insp|13.340|24.337|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-1)<br>2 Insp|14.525|16.591|No|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-2)<br>2 Insp|17.578|21.565|Yes|\n|Observe<br>LongerComm&HP1<br>(ATD-3)<br>2 Insp|14.848|19.675|No|\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 6_ _Variant Scenarios Analysis_\n\n_Table 6.25: Overview for the Observe&Retrieve scenari", "char_len": 6000}

This software\ncombines the orbit information with the accuracy of space surveillance systems to evaluate the statistical\nnumber of collision avoidance manoeuvres as a function of the acceptable risk levels [22]. In particular, the\ndecision to perform a CAM is related to the risk associated with a near-miss event, which in turn depends\non the geometry of the of the encounter, the collision cross-section, and the uncertainties in the state\nvector of both objects. Since in LEO there are many poorly tracked objects with a location uncertainty in the\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\norder of kilometres (assumed to be a Gaussian distribution) and a part of them cannot even be tracked, the\nrisk threshold is best defined in terms of risk reduction with respect to the unavoidable background\npopulation. This value is defined as a function of the ACPL (Accepted Collision Probability Level), which most\nspace missions set at 10 [-4] [24].\n\nTo start the analysis, the start epoch was set to 2024/11/01, which is when the satellite is deployed in the\nSTK simulation. Since ARES considers SROC with a spherical shape, the spacecraft radium was set equal to\nthe distance from the centre of SROC to its furthest point, which is half of the diagonal (0.233 m). The orbit\nused for this analysis is the same used in STK and it is defined in Table 7.1.\n\n_Table 7.1: Orbit definition in DRAMA_\n\n|Orbital Parameter|Value|\n|---|---|\n|Semi-major axis|6771 km|\n|Eccentricity|0|\n|Inclinaton|6.2 deg|\n|Right Ascension of the Ascending node (RAAN)|0 deg|\n|Angle of Perigee|0 deg|\n|True Anomaly|0 deg|\n\n7.2.1 MASTER Analysis\n\nBefore analysing the ACPL it is useful to evaluate the space debris flux in the target orbit in order to\nunderstand the space debris situation that the satellite will encounter. Useful information can be\nextrapolated from this analysis, such as the direction from which it can be expected to receive most of the\nconjunctions (if there are any). Moreover, this additional analysis, although it is not strictly required to\nassess the CAM required, is still recommended in ARES guidelines document [22]. To perform this study an\nadditional ESA software is used: MASTER (Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference)\n\n[25].\n\nThe analysis was conducted on the same orbit described in Table 7.1 and for debris with the same size as\nthe ones analysed in ARES, which are from 1 cm to 100 m of diameter. Technically, MASTER can provide\nfluxes of impact object size down to 1 micrometre, but ARES only considers only an impact object size down\nto 1 cm, since it is the best resolution achievable by state-of-the-art ground surveillance systems. The most\nrelevant results are the 2D flux distribution of the debris according to the azimuth and elevation angles.\nFrom the first one (Figure 7.2) it is possible to see that the flux is distributed between all the possible\nazimuth values, which means that there is the possibility of a reverse conjunction (that is debris\napproaching SROC from the back). The probability of this type of collision, however, is lower with respect to\none coming from the front, especially if the range from -80 deg to -40 deg is considered.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n_Figure 7.2:Flux Distribution according to the Impact Azimuth_\n\ndebris are encountered along null or very low elevation angles, with a flux distribution almost constantly\ndecreasing with the increasing of the impact elevation angles.\n\n_Figure 7.3: Flux Distribution according to the Impact Elevation_\n\nhomogeneously distributed across the impact velocity range, which varies from 1 km/s to 28 km/s but\npresents the highest values for lower impact velocities.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n_Figure 7.4: Flux Distribution according to the Impact Velocity_\n\nminimum diameters there are the maximum values. As mentioned before, the flux distribution is evaluated\nconsidering objects with a diameter set between a minimum and a maximum value. The values selected for\nboth ARES and Master are the default ones, which in the DRAMA user manual are said to be sufficient for\nan adequate risk analysis.\n\n_Figure 7.5: Flux Distribution according to the Object Diameter_\n\n7.2.2 ARES set - up\n\nAfter setting the spacecraft orbit and radius, and the range size for the debris, the radar equation [21] is\nconfigured to estimate the cataloguing performance:\n\n𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 (ℎ) = 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑓 ℎ [ℎ]\n∙( 𝑟𝑒𝑓\n\n~~)~~\n\n𝑒𝑥𝑝\n\nWhere 𝐷 𝑚𝑖𝑛 is the minimum detectable diameter, 𝐷 𝑟𝑒𝑓 is a reference diameter, ℎ is the orbit altitude and\nℎ 𝑟𝑒𝑓 is a reference altitude.

The inputs for both branches are the default ones.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\nThe reason why this equation is used is that ARES’s scope is to simulate the CAM in the entirety of the\nactions which would take place in the real operative scenario, to the extent that every supporting space\nsurveillance network has a certain minimum detectable radius. For this reason, even the time between the\nprediction of a collision and the actual occurrence of it is considered; this parameter was set to 1 day. There\nis also the possibility to set a global scaling factor to correct the population covariances; to set a neutral\nscaling factor, this value was set to 1.", "char_len": 5817}

Ten different values for the ACPL were considered as\nwell as ten values for the orbit revolutions between manoeuvre and event. ARES always considers a short\nterm (half an orbit) along-track manoeuvre, while these values are used to consider one-day-increasing\ndurations for the orbit revolutions. The target collision probability level is a scaling factor for the ACPL which\ndefines the target collision probability for a collision avoidance manoeuvre. It is set to 0.1, which means\nthat, if the ACPL is 10 [-5], then ARES triggers a manoeuvre for each event with a collision probability level\nabove 0.1x10 [-5] . The propulsion system category (cold gas) and specific impulse (42 s) were defined in\naccordance with SROC system design document [20].

Typically, what is aimed\nat is a risk reduction of around 90% and a ACPL of at least 10 [-4] : in this case, these recommendations are\nmeth with an ACPL of 10 [-6] . The residual risk is calculated considering all the risks with a collision probability\ninferior to the defined threshold; in turn, the risk reduction is the accumulated collision probability of the\nevents above the decision threshold. Besides these two parameters, there is a third one called remaining\nrisk, which is the risk due to non-trackable objects, whose contribution is usually not shown since nothing\ncan be done about them. Figure 7.8 illustrates that the mean number of avoidance manoeuvres increases\nalmost logarithmically with the decrease of the ACPL, with a maximum value of 0.3 manoeuvres to\nguarantee an ACPL of 10 [-6] . This number refers to a mean number evaluated for a year of propagation.\n\n_Figure 7.7: Risk reduction and residual risk as function of the ACPL_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n_Figure 7.8: Manoeuvres frequency as function of the ACPL_\n\nBefore defining a final value for the ACPL and showing other useful results, a robustness analysis is\nrecommended [22]. The following cases were considered:\n\n -30% of the time between the event detection and the event occurrence (0.7 days); for a shorter\ninterval, DRAMA does not guarantee the capability to avoid the manoeuvre;\n\n Double the time between the event detection and the event occurrence (2 days);\n\n - Double the scale factor on covariance (2);\n\nFor the first variation, the results (Figure 7.9 and Figure 7.10) show that there is an increase in the risk\nreduction (around 91% for an ACPL of 10 [-6] ), but also a decrease in the mean number of avoidance\nmanoeuvres (almost 0.26 per year for an ACPL of 10 [-6] ). In the second case (Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.12), for\nan ACPL of 10 [-6], the risk reduction is only 82% and the required number of avoidance manoeuvres is 0.34 (a\nbit more than the nominal case). The third and final case, as expected, shows worse results (Figure 7.13 and\n\nrequired number of manoeuvres is 0.4. Moreover, the risk reduction decreases to 50% for much lower\nvalues (around 10 [-5] ) with respect to the nominal analysis. In conclusion, although noticeable changes\nhappen between the different scenarios, the robustness of the analysis and the solution is consistent with\nthe results provided in the verification guidelines of ARES [22].\n\n_Figure 7.9: First case - Risk reduction and residual risk as_\n\n_function of the ACPL_\n\n_Figure 7.10: First case - Manoeuvres frequency as function of the_\n\n_ACPL_\n\n_Figure 7.11: Second case - Risk reduction and residual risk as_\n\n_function of the ACPL_\n\n_Figure 7.13: Third case - Risk reduction and residual risk as_\n\n_function of the ACPL_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n_Figure 7.12: Second case - Manoeuvres frequency as function of_\n\n_the ACPL_\n\n_Figure 7.14: Third case - Manoeuvres frequency as function of_\n\n_the ACPL_\n\nTo achieve a much higher risk reduction, the ACPL could be lowered even more.

Two different\ntypes of strategies are implemented by ARES [23]:\n\n Short–term strategy: it is the one evaluated for a number of revolutions = 0. It targets additional\nradial separation between the two objects at the TCA (Time of Closest Approach).\n\n Long-term strategy: different manoeuvres are evaluated for different multiples of one revolution.\nThey target a different phasing and thus a larger along- and/or cross-track separation at the TCA.\nThe required deltaV to perform these manoeuvres decreases with the increase of the number of\nrevolutions before the TCA.\n\nFor the selected ACPL level (the purple line) the maximum deltaV (0.123 m/s) is required for a long-term\nstrategy starting one revolution before the TCA.

These values would be useful to allocate the deltaV budget for missions staying in the\nsame orbit for several years, which is not the case for SROC. For this reason, the selected deltaV was divided\nby 0.3 to assess the deltaV required to perform a single manoeuvre.

The spacecraft parameters were\ndefined as follows:\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n\n - Cross-section area [m [2] ]: 0.1014, which is the value computed by CROC.\n\n - Mass [kg]: 21 kg\n\n Drag coefficient: 2.2\n\n Reflectivity coefficient: 1.3\n\n\nThe initial orbit is the same described in Table 7.1, but the begin date (YYYY-MM-DD) is 2021-11-15 at\n00:00, which is approximately when the proximity operation phase should end. OSCAR requires to define\nthe disposal option, which in this case is none. The orbit prediction is dependent on the prediction for the\nsolar and geomagnetic activities used, since, as it has already been explained in Sub-section 3.2.1, they\nwere used to model the atmospheric drag. To account for these differences, three analyses were\nperformed, which all confirm that SROC deorbits less than 13 months, thus respecting the Space Debris\nMitigations for Agency projects [7].\n\n\n - **ECSS sample solar cycle** : final date (YYYY-MM-DD) 2025-04-22\nThis analysis is recommended by the ECSS standard [26] and uses the solar and geomagnetic\nparameters of the solar cycle 23 for the complete propagation time span.\n\n\n_Figure 7.19: ECSS Sample - SROC altitude vs time_\n\n\n **Latest predictions** : final date (YYYY-MM-DD) 2025-06-05\nThis model uses the available up-to-date prediction on solar and geomagnetic activity provided by\nESA.

The\npredicted final date becomes (YYYY-MM-DD) 2025-11-16, as shown in Figure 7.21. Figure 7.22\nconfirms what has previously been presented regarding the dependence of the orbital lifetime on\nthe solar activity: the worst case has a lower activity (light blue line), thus the drag is minor and the\norbital lifetime is higher.\n\n\n_Figure 7.21: Lifetime comparison between the worst case and nominal case_\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n\n_Figure 7.22: Solar activity comparison between worst case and nominal case_\n\n\n - **Monte Carlo Analysis** : final date (YYYY-MM-DD) 2025-04-09\nThis analysis is one of the ISO-recommended methods [28] and requires the random selection for\neach day within the propagation time span of a solar and geomagnetic activity data triplet (daily\nand mean F10.7 as well as daily planetary amplitude Ap) from a specified number of solar cycles,\nwhich can vary between 1 and 6.

This assessment is performed using the tool SARA,\nwhose main settings and satellite model definition are reported in this section.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n7.4.1 SARA setngs and SROC model def ti i niton i\n\nFirst, it is necessary to define the basic settings of the analysis. The software is run in expert mode to\ncorrectly define several parameters which could not be defined in basic mode. The initial orbit is the same\nused for ARES and OSCAR (Table 2.1), as well as the beginning date. The inputs for the propagation setting\nwere defined in accordance with the setting for OSCAR, since SARA uses OSCAR to propagate the state of\nthe satellite until it reaches 140 km in altitude. From here down, the propagator used is that of SARA, which\nalso automatically evaluated the cross-section and the drag coefficient. Therefore, the following\npropagation settings only define OSCAR’s propagation:\n\n Reflectivity coefficient: 1.3\n\n Cross-section: 0.101 m [3]\n\n Drag coefficient: 2.2\n\nThe initial at **t** iude was set to tumbling, while the at **t** iude of the fragments was set to “inherited”, which\nmeans that the at **t** iude is inherited from the satellite. Since the SROC is randomly tumbling, the fragments\nwill be randomly tumbling too. An important parameter is the Voxelator resolution length, which\ndetermines the size of the voxels used when estimating the aerothermodynamic properties of the\ncompound object. A voxel is a 3D cube located on a three-dimensional grid used to create 3D models [31]: if\nits resolution length is low, it increases the faithfulness of the results, but it will also increase the run-time.\nTo select a proper value, both the dimension of SROC components and SARA’s limitation on the maximum\nnumber of voxels were considered, obtaining a Voxelator resolution length of 2 mm.\n\nThe environment is defined considering a dynamic atmospheric model, which includes a solar and\ngeomagnetic activity database based on ESA’s latest prediction’s (the same used in OSCAR) and an\natmospheric wind model. Finally, the on-ground risk is defined considering a casualty threshold of 15 J. This\nis the lowest kinetic energy to be considered for the on-ground risk assessment; 15J is the default values in\nSARA. The re-entry is modelled considering a non-controlled type from a circular orbit with an inclination of\n6.2 deg. Figure 7.24 is a screenshot from SARA showing all the basic settings.\n\nti i i\n\n**t** **t**\n**t**\n\nti i i\n\n**t** **t**\n**t**\n\n_Figure 7.24: SARA Basic Settings_\n\nThe SROC model was defined considering the recommendations from SARA’s user manual [30]. To produce\nan accurate assessment of the re-entry risk, the model was built considering SROC’s components with the\nhighest mass and volume. Their virtual counterparts are modelled to resemble their mass, volume and\nshape as close as possible. Moreover, SARA lets the user select the material of the component from a\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\nmaterial list, whose element either represent a physical material (such as the AA7075) or the properties of a\npiece of equipment. One example of this last category is the material El-Mat which is the equivalent\nmaterial to model electronic components [29]. By, selecting the material, the following properties are set:\ndensity, melting temperature, specific heat at 300 K, heat of melting, conductivity and emissivity.\n\nEach object added to the model is ordered with a parent-children method: components on the same level\nof the hierarchy can be connected one to another; moreover, it is possible to define the connection area\nbetween them and one or more “Dissolution Triggers”, such as the temperature or the altitude. When the\nconditions specified on the “Dissolution Trigger” window are met, the components separate from each\nother. For each parent component, it is possible to define a “Chid Release Trigger”: when one of the\nselected conditions is met the children objects contained inside the parent will be released. It is important\nto notice that when the “Chid Release Trigger” is triggered, the parent object disappears from the\nsimulation even if it has not demised yet. For this reason, no “Child Release Trigger” is active during the\nanalysis: the objects contained inside another one are released only when the latter is demised.\n\nThe higher hierarchical level of the model is composed by of following elements:\n\n - Structure\n\n Solar Panel x (the solar panel on the positive x face of SROC)\n\n Solar Panel y (the solar panel on the negative y face of SROC)\n\n - UHF Antenna\n\nAll the last three objects are connected to the structure, with a connection area equal to the contact area\nthey have with the structure (0.0174 m [2] for the solar panels and 0.00746 m [2] for the antennas). The\ndissolution trigger for all these connections is when the altitude decreases below 103 km, as suggested by\nthe SARA user manual [30]. Table 7.3 contains a list of all the components added to the model, as well as\ntheir mass, volume, shape and material used. The mass and volume of the components reported in the\nSROC system definition file [20] are added to compare the differences with the objects in the SARA model.", "char_len": 5587}

For the Load Controller Module (LCM) and the RWA it was preferred to\nuse a bigger volume to maintain a representative mass of the component. The Torque rod, instead, is\nmaintained a lower mass since the absolute difference between the actual component is only 58 g which\ndoes not affect significantly the mass budget of the model.\n\nThe following materials were used to define the structural and thermal properties of the equipment\ncomposing the satellite [29]:\n\n - Drama-AA7075: this class is used for aluminum alloys as the baseline.

This\nrecommendation is respected since the total mass of the model is 13.945 kg, while the total mass reported\nin the SROC system definition file [20] is 16.062 kg, which means that 84.82% of SROC mass is considered. It\nis noted that the reference values used to build the model include the margins on the single component,\nwhile the total system margin is not considered. A comparison between the CAD of the internal\ncomponents of SROC and the components of the SARA model is presented in Figure 7.25.\n\n7.4.2 SARA results\n\nThe most important result is the assessment of the total re-entry risk:\n\n - Total casualty area: 0\n\n - Total casualty probability: 0\n\n - Total fatality probability: 0\n\nSo, according to SARA’s estimate, the satellite does not constitute a potential threat to on-ground safety\nsince it is completely demised during the re-entry. Before starting the analysis of the re-entry of the\nspacecraft and its fragments, it is necessary to define when, according to SARA, an object is demised [32]:\n\n - Complete mass loss (on both Figure 7.26 and Figure 7.27 these points are marked as “Demise\npoints”);\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n The kinetic energy of the object drops below the 15 J threshold (on the graphs these points are\nmarked as “Uncritical points”);\n\n - Ballooning, where an object is not allowed to become unphysically thin (on the graphs these points\nare marked as “Ballooning points”);Figure 7.26:\n\n_Figure 7.26: Altitude as function of the Time of all Objects_\n\n1800 seconds from the start of the re-entry, the compound is still whole, but at 103 km, as imposed by the\ndissolution trigger, the solar panels and the antenna separate from the structure and are then demised\nrespectively around 92 km and 88 km. The structure keeps its re-entry until it demises at approximately 85\nkm (this point is highlighted by the blue cross in the graph) at 2200 seconds. After that, all the internal\ncomponents inside the structure are released and most of them reach the uncritical point in the successive\nminutes (red squares). The last component to demise is the RWA which reached the ballooning point at 60\nkm after approximately 2300 seconds from the start of the re-entry. The reason why this component\ndemises after all the others is probably due to its material (Drama-A316) which is more resistant than the\nDrama-AA7075 to the high temperature faced during the re-entry.\n\nand 16500 km, with the longest distance obtained by the RWA assembly.\n\n_-_\n_Chapter 7_ _DRAMA Analysis_\n\n_Figure 7.27: Altitude as function of the Downrange of all Objects_", "char_len": 5771}

At the beginning of this document, a brief review of the mission was presented to give\nsome context about the mission objectives, its requirements, and the two Concept of Operations.\n\n\nAll the STK scenarios, Matlab function, and files JSON were reorganized to delete the unnecessary ones or\nto unify similar functions into only one; moreover, all the variables used by this software were renamed to\nbe coherent with the names reported in the MAR produced at the end of the phase B1. Finally, the Matlab\nfunction which optimizes the IPA rendezvous and the one which defines HP2 and HP3 were modified to\nimprove respectively the optimization of the IPA and the performance during the HPs. After these changes,\nthe nominal scenario was updated to a new orbit and used to study several aspects of the mission: the WSE\nof the observation phase, the ground station coverage, and the optimal time windows to perform the Final\nApproach. It was noticed that the ground station coverage may not be enough to guarantee a sufficiently\nlong communication window, so two possible solutions were presented. Using a GEO satellite constellation\ncould be the best option since it guarantees an uninterrupted link with SROC.\n\n\nIt was proven that the synergic use of Matlab and STK can greatly decrease the duration of an iterative\nanalysis by automatizing the set-up, run, and post-processing of every iteration. This property was\nparticularly useful during the variant scenarios analysis, where STK’s object model interface was used to\nconnect the STK scenario to the Matlab functions and to evaluate the nominal or variant segments of the\nMCS. At first, all the possible variant events were considered isolated, which means that every one of them\nwas evaluated inside an MCS where no other variant events took place. Thanks to this process it was\npossible to assess how every variant event changes the total duration and deltaV cost, and if and how they\ninfluence the successive segments of the MCS. For some variants, different solutions were considered to\neither minimize the deltaV cost or the duration of the mission. After that, all the possible combinations of\nvariant events were analysed for both the Observe and the Observe&Retrieve scenarios. All their results\nwere saved in an Excel database with an interactive interface that lets an external user define the desired\nMCS and then shows the relative DeltaV and duration budgets. All the variant scenarios were analysed to\ndefine which were off-nominal because of a higher deltaV cost, higher duration, or inadequate safety\nrelative to Space Rider. For every variant MCS it was found at least one valid solution, thus proving the\n\nrobustness of the mission.\n\n\nThe ESA software DRAMA was used to study other aspects of the mission, all required by SROC’s Statement\nof Work for Phases B2/C/D. The number of CAM manoeuvre and the relative deltaV cost was assessed as a\nfunction of the Accepted Collision Probability Level; since this analysis gave a mean number of annual\nmanoeuvres inferior to one, the annual deltaV suggested by DRAMA was rescaled to the cost of one\n\nmanoeuvre. The OSCAR tool was used to verify the compliance of the SROC mission with the Space Debris\nMitigations for Agency projects and, finally, the tool SARA was used to assess the total re-entry risk. To\nperform this last task, a simplified digital twin of SROC was generated using SARA. The results of the analysis\nwith OSCAR confirmed the compliance with the Space Debris Mitigations for Agency projects, while the\nSARA analysis assessed that the mission does not constitute any on-ground risk, since the satellite demises\nbefore an altitude equal to 60 km.\n\n\nThe next step for Phase B2 could involve a new definition for the WSE: as mentioned before, the current\nMatlab functions produce an acceptable approximation if used to evaluate the deltaV cost and the duration\nof the observation phase, but the fact that it is not possible to define the exact geometrical features of the\n\n_Chapter 8 - Conclusions_\n\n\nWSE does not make it suitable to evaluate other aspects of this phase, such as the interval at which the\nrange and illuminations constraints are met. This improvement could be pursued through a new Matlab\nfunction that analytically evaluates the desired WSE or using STK’s default segments for rendezvous and\nproximity operations. Another interesting update could be adding a thruster set module which is\nrepresentative of the properties of SROC’s thruster module. Finally, regarding the analysis of the\ncommunication windows with SROC, it will be necessary to assess if a GEO link is feasible from different\npoints of view, such as the cost and the system ones.", "char_len": 5056}

When referring to the SRS, we consider the entire ecosystem of flight\n\n\nsegment, ground segment and facilities that are needed to perform a mission and to support\n\n\nthe Customers for their business. The Space Rider (SR) vehicle, as the main part of the SRS\n\n\nflight segment, is an uncrewed robotic laboratory about the size of two minivans composed by\n\n\na re-entry module and an orbital module. Its dynamic configuration allows P/Ls for an array of\n\n\napplications, orbit altitudes and inclinations (compatible with the performance of the launcher),\n\n\nand mission durations. After being launched it will stay in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for about two\n\n\nmonths, while performing experiments inside its cargo bay such as technology demonstration\n\n\nand research activities in different fields (e.g., pharmaceutics, biology, physical science, ...). At\n\n\nthe end of its mission, the re-entry module will return to Earth and land on a dedicated area to\n\n\nretrieve the flown payloads while the orbital module performs a destructive re-entry.

In this digital era, where\n\n\ncyber threats are becoming more sophisticated and pervasive, the implementation of robust\n\n\ncybersecurity measures is not just a precaution, but a necessity.\n\n\nBy ensuring the protection of critical systems and data, Space Rider cybersecurity measures\n\n\nnot only enhance the reliability and safety of its missions but also contribute to the overall\n\n\nsuccess by maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of vital mission-related\n\n\ninformation. In this context, Space Rider's cybersecurity framework, with its in-depth security\n\n\nof mission-critical aspects, plays a key role in fortifying the mission against digital threats, thus\n\n\nensuring its smooth and successful execution.\n\n\nFor missions like Space Rider, effective cybersecurity safeguards are in place to counter a\n\n\nnumber of potential cyber-attacks that could compromise mission integrity, disrupt\n\n\ncommunications, or even lead to catastrophic failures.\n\n\nThese security measures are especially significant in the context of Space Rider, where they\n\n\nprovide a robust shield against threats like the following:\n\n\n**Interception and Eavesdropping**\n\n\nTransmitted data can be intercepted by unauthorized parties. This data could contain sensitive\n\n\nmission information or control commands. Space Rider ensures that even if the data sent from\n\n\nground to the orbiter is intercepted, it remains unintelligible and useless to the interceptor.\n\n\n**Unauthorized Command and Control**\n\n\nOne of the most critical threats to a satellite is the unauthorized access and issuance of\n\n\ncommands. This could lead to a hostile takeover of the satellite's functionalities. Security\n\n\ncontrols are implemented in Space Rider to ensures that only commands from verified and\n\n\ntrusted sources are accepted and executed.\n\n\nPage 90/114\n\n\nIssue 2.0 Date 06/12/2023 Ref.

To counter this Space Rider implements telecommand\n\n\nencryption, combined with authentication, that helps in maintaining the integrity of the data,\n\n\nensuring that any alterations are easily detectable and preventable.\n\n\n**Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**\n\n\nThese attacks occur when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the\n\n\ncommunication between two parties. Space Rider make use of robust encryption and\n\n\nauthentication protocols make it exceedingly difficult for attackers to insert themselves into the\n\n\ncommunication channel.\n\n\n**Replay Attacks**\n\n\nThis scenario foreseen an attacker that captures a legitimate message and replays it to create\n\n\nan unauthorized effect. The Space Rider implements sophisticated authentication algorithms\n\n\nwhich includes different factors like time stamps or sequence numbers, which help in identifying\n\n\nand discarding repeated messages.\n\n\nThe benefits of these security measures contributing significantly to raise the resilience of the\n\n\nmission against cyber threats, thereby preserving the integrity and confidentiality of mission\n\ncritical data and maintaining the overall safety and success of the mission.", "char_len": 3580}

ESA-STS-SR-TN-2018-0002\n\n\nESA UNCLASSIFIED – Releasable to the Public\n\n\n**Transparent Infrastructure**\n\n\nThe transparency in Space Rider's infrastructure means that payload operators have clear\n\n\nvisibility into how their payloads are integrated within the vehicle. This visibility allows payload\n\n\noperators to understand the specific risks and vulnerabilities relevant to their payloads and to\n\n\ndesign their security measures accordingly.\n\n\n**Segregated Infrastructure**\n\n\nSegregation of the infrastructure ensures that each payload operates within its own dedicated\n\n\ndomain, isolated from the others. This segregation is crucial for security, as it prevents any\n\n\npotential cross-contamination of cyber threats between payloads. It also means that security\n\n\nmeasures implemented by one payload do not inadvertently impact the functionality or security\n\n\nof another.\n\n\n**Opportunities for Payload-Specific Security**\n\n\nPayload operators have the flexibility to implement their own encryption and authentication\n\n\nmeasures tailored to their specific needs and risk profiles. For instance, a payload requiring\n\n\nhigh confidentiality can employ advanced encryption algorithms to protect its data. Similarly,\n\n\npayloads with critical control functions can implement robust authentication protocols to ensure\n\n\nthat only authorized commands are executed.\n\n\nThis approach allows for a more customized and targeted cybersecurity strategy for each\n\n\npayload, catering to diverse requirements and levels of sensitivity. It empowers payload\n\n\noperators to take charge of their cybersecurity, enabling them to leverage Space Rider's\n\n\nadvanced infrastructure while maintaining control over their specific security needs.\n\n\nIn summary, while Space Rider itself may not yet extend its core cybersecurity protections to\n\n\npayloads, its transparent and segregated infrastructure provides a conducive environment for\n\n\npayloads to independently secure themselves, ensuring overall mission integrity and security.\n\n\nPage 92/114\n\n\nIssue 2.0 Date 06/12/2023 Ref.

With\nthe SR it is possible to do research in the earths low orbit. The SR can return to earth and is\ncapable of landing at a predefined position by means of a guided parafoil. This report discusses,\nwhich dynamical effects are relevant to construct a model, describing the flight dynamics of the\nSR during its guided parafoil descend. First the already existing models, which are found in\nthe literature, are discussed. A 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) and a 12 DoF model is presented.\nTHe models are simulated in Simulink. The results are analyses and compared with simulation\nresults found in the literature for an already existing model. The models are linearized and\nthe flight dynamics of the linearizations are analyzed. It can be concluded that the gravity,\naerodynamics and apparent mass are all relevant to the flight dynamics during the descent of the\nSR. The 6 DoF models shows the overall flight behavior needed for position, velocity and heading\ncontrol. The 12 DOF model give additional dynamics, which are insightful in the presence of\nwind disturbances or during the landing.", "char_len": 1638}

To overcome\nthe effect of gravity to do microgravity research, multiple methods are currently used. Like a\nvacuum chamber, in which a free fall can be reached, an airplane in parabolic flight or by launching a rocket within the earths atmosphere. The approaches have limitations on the experiment\nlength up to several minutes. Therefore, ESA is currently developing a module, the Space Rider\n(SR), that can do research in low orbit. The SR is launched in low orbit and can stay there for\nmultiple months to perform microgravity research. Other possible tasks could be validation and\ndemonstration of robotic exploration, earth observation and telecommunication. Even satellite\ninspection is a possibility [1].\n\n\nOne of the objectives of the project is the re-usability of the SR. Therefore, the SR should\nreturn to the earth, such that it is undamaged and retrievable. A strategy is developed for the\ndecent of the SR. First, the SR re-enters the atmosphere at a high velocity. As following, A\ndrogue parachute is used to decelerate the SR to a velocity and altitude at which the guided\nparafoil can be deployed. With the guided parafoil, the SR ca steer and navigate to the landing\npoint, where it eventually lands gently. This last part, which is the terminal guidance phase, is\nfull of challenges. The control of the SR is handled by the Guidance, Navigation and Control\nsystem (GNC) and should be able to guide the SR to a precision landing in the presence of wind\ndisturbances and ensure a soft landing. A soft landing means an impact with bounded velocity.\n\n\nOne way to quantify the performance of the developed GNC solution is by performing a MonteCarlo simulation for different wind disturbances and creating a normal distribution around the\nlanding position and the desired impact velocity. This can provide sufficient verification of the\nlanding precision of the GNC. To support the development of such a simulation environment a\nmodel is needed that captures the relevant descending dynamics of the SR with the parafoil [2].\nThe developed GNC solution can be improved with the simulation environment. This report\nanswers the question: Which dynamic effects acting on the SR during the terminal guidance\nphase should be considered, to describe the flight dynamics of the Space Rider w.r.t. the desired\nlanding precision and landing constraints of the GNC system?\n\n\nThe Space Rider during the terminal descent phase is connected to the parafoil with tension\nlines as shown in Figure 1. The Space Rider steers itself by deflecting the parafoils trailing edge,\neventually very similar as an airplane would be steered. The steering lines, which are not the\nsame as the tension lines, connect the trailing edge of the parafoil and the SR. They are controlled by the GNC system. The SR with the guided parafoil falls in the category of precision\naerial delivery systems (PADS) and can be modeled accordingly.\n\n\n\nYakimenko [3] gives an overview of some proposed models to capture the flight dynamics of a\nPADS. As low fidelity model a 3 DoF model is used, assuming a point mass moving with a\nvelocity in three directions. The complexity is increased with a 6 DoF model, where the whole\nsystem is assumed to be one rigid body. By including some relative DoF between the parafoil\nand the load a 7-9 DoF model can be created. A 12 DoF model is obtained when the load can\n\nmove in all six directions relative to the parafoil. The models included aerodynamics, apparent\nmass and gravity as dynamc effects.\n\n\nThe report structure is as following. First, a literature overview is given. The existing models,\nwhich describe the flight dynamics of a PADS are presented, in terms of the included dynamic\neffects. Next a 6 DoF mathematical model is proposed for a PADS, which is extended to a 12\nDoF model. In the models, the aerodynamic effect, apparent mass effect and the gravity will\nbe considered.

The presented models have varying complexity from 3-4 DoF models, 6 DoF models,\n7-9 DoF models and a 12 DoF model. Furthermore, the models can be characterized by the\nincluded dynamics effects and how these dynamics are included. Sec. 2.1 describes the complexity\norder of the models and the included dynamc effects. Additional literature of the dynamic effects\nis discussed in Sec. 2.2 and 2.3. Also simulation parameters simulation results and experimental\nresults are found in the literature and are discussed in Sec. 2.4.\n\n**2.1** **Existing models and complexity**\n\nFor each model complexity the included dynamic effects are discussed. the models are presented\nin order of complexity. The 3 DoF models are described by Yakimenko [4], Bonaccorsi [5] and\nRademacher [6]. The model consists of a point mass, which can move in the x-y-z direction,\nwith a velocity vector. The acting forces on the system are the gravity and aerodynamic lift and\ndrag. The aerodynamics are modeled with a constant trim coefficient, which can be altered for\nthe control deflections. With the control deflections the system can be decelerated and steered.\nA delay is used to approximate the repose time of the system to a control input. The output of\nthe system are the position and velocity and the inputs are the control deflections. The wind is\nembedded as the disturbance. Yakimenko extends the model in [4] to a 4 DoF model by including\na yawing rate in the model.\n\nThe model complexity is increased with the 6 DoF model, described by Figueroa-Gonz´alez [2],\nYakimenko [3], [4], Bonaccorsi [5], Ward [7], and Mazouz [8]. The PADS is represented as one\nrigid body with a single mass and inertia. The model can move along the axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, but also rotate with the Euler angles. The model therefore considers the velocity\nvector but also the angular velocity. In the 6 DoF models the following dynamic effects are included. The gravity, still works the same as in the 4-3 DoF models. The aerodynamics, consisting\nof a drag, lift and side force as well as three aerodynamic moments. The aerodynamic coefficients\nare used to express the aerodynamic force and moment. These coefficients can be described with\na linear model in an operation range as used by Yakimenko [3], [4], Bonaccorsi [5] and Mazouz [8]\nor with a mix of a look-up table and a linear model as is used by Figueroa-Gonz´alez [2]. In a\n6 DoF model the apparent mass can be included. The apparent mass describes additional pressure forces on the body. Figueroa-Gonz´alez [2] argues that the effect is not significant for their\napplication. They say it is only relevant for application with loading more than 5 [ _Kg/m_ [2] ].\nYakimenko [4], Bonaccorsi [5] and Mazouz [8] argue it is important for their application. They\nimplement the apparent mass effect, with the momentum and angular momentum of the apparent\nmass being decoupled in a center of apparent mass. Yakimenko [3] also implements the effect in\na version where the momentum and angular momentum of the apparent mass are not decoupled.\nThe output of the model describes the position and orientation of rigid body with its velocity\nand angular rate. The input of the model are the control deflections and the wind is a disturbance.\n\nThe system derived by Ward [9] is considered a 6 DoF model. Even though the paper considers the parafoil and the load as separate rigid body, it also uses rigid connections to connect\nboth bodies. These rigid lines can be controlled to vary the center of mass (CoM) of the system\nsteer the direction of the system. The type aerodynamic model is the same as used by Yakimenko [4]. The apparent mass is considered, but the implementation manner remains unclear.\n\nA 7-9 DoF model includes relative degrees to freedom between the parafoil and the load. Yakimenko [4] shows three models for 7-9 DoF. The aerodynamic and gravity are separated in a set\nof dynamic effects for the load and for the parafoil. Each degree of freedom represents an extra\nrotation the load can make, in an attachment point, w.r.t. the parafoil. The expressions for the\naerodynamics of the load and parafoil are similar to the expressions used in the 6 DoF model.\nThe apparent mass is considered in decoupled form.\n\nRedelinghuys [10], Sleger [11], Yakimenko [3] and Zhu [12] all present an 8 DoF model. Zhu [12]\nallows a relative pitch and yaw angle between the load and the parafoil. The relative motion is\nconstraint with tension forces. A torsional spring-damper system is used. To model the aerodynamics, the parafoil is divided in multiple panels and the aerodynamic drag and lift are modeled\nper panel. The aerodynamic moment is derived as a result of the aerodynamic force. The load\nis only influenced by a drag component. A linear model is used to determine the aerodynamic\ncoefficients and a coupled apparent mass effect is considered. The 8 DoF model developed by [11]\nconsiders the same relative pitch and yaw angles as additional degrees of freedom. The same\napproach is used to constrain the relative angles, with tension forces. The aerodynamics are considered the same as used by Yakimenko [4]. The apparent mass effect is considered in decoupled\nform. Yakimenko [3] develops a general model structure for an 8 DoF model, but does not show\nhow specific components can be modeled.", "char_len": 5581}

The added DoF are still a relative\npitch and yaw angle. Instead of defining the model along the classical Newtonian formulations,\nthe model presented is based on the Hamiltonian approach. A non-linear restoring moment is\nformulated on the relative yaw angle. The paper considers the combination of a parafoil with\nan unmanned air vehicles (UAV). Therefore, a full aerodynamic expression is used for both\nthe parafoil and the load. This includes a drag, lift and side force and all three aerodynamic\nmoments. The coefficients for the parafoil are calculated with Computational Fluid Dynamics\n(CFD) and a fit was determined on top of the lookup table. This gives a linearization in a moving\noperation point. The aerodynamic coefficients of the UAV are constant and the apparent mass\nis not included.\n\nA 12 DoF model is presented by Glouchtchenko [13]. Both the parafoil and the load are considered as a rigid body. The aerodynamic forces and gravity are separately modeled on both\nbodies. A suspension line model is proposed as a spring damper system. Four suspension lines\nare modeled into one single joint. The parafoil is connected to the joint with a half rigid and half\nspring damper connection. This brings as difficulty that the position of the joint is determined\nby solving the force balance of multiple spring damper systems. The aerodynamics are partly\ndetermined via a look-up map and with a linear model. The apparent mass is embedded in\ncoupled form in the parafoil rigid body.\n\nTo conclude, the 3-4 DoF models are used when considering only steady-state flight dynamics, due to the constant aerodynamic coefficients. The turning response is an approximation\nwith a delay. The 6 DoF models are used to consider the dynamic behavior of the system and\nhas varying steady-state flight dynamics due to a more comprehensive aerodynamic model with\nvarying aerodynamic coefficients. Due to the implementation of an inertia and the moments\nworking on the system, the 6 DoF model can turn with all three Euler angles. A 7-9 DoF model\nis used to express some relative DoF between the load and the parafoil, these extra DoF can be\nconstraint with spring-damper systems. A 12 DoF model give the load full relative movement\nfreedom with respect of the parafoil, the relative DoF is constraint with multiple spring-damper\n\nsystems representing the tension lines. All presented models consider the gravity and the aerodynamics relevant for the flight dynamics of the PADS. The 6-12 DoF model considers a more\ncomprehensive expression for the aerodynamics, than the 3-4 DoF models. In the 6-12 DoF\nmodels the aerodynamic coefficients can be modeled in a linear model, a look-up table or a mixture of both. The aerodynamic coefficients are obtained via analytical expressions, experimental\nresult or CFD analyzes. The apparent mass is only included as relevant to the flight dynamics\nin the 6-12 DoF models. The apparent mass can be included in the 6-12 DoF models. Not all\npapers included the apparent mass, based on the application. The apparent mass is included\nin to manners. The first one considers the momentum and angular momentum of the apparent\nmass to be decoupled, while the second approach considers it coupled. The apparent mass is\ndiscussed further in Sec. 2.2.\n\n**2.2** **Apparent mass effect**\n\nThe apparent mass effect on a PADS is described by Lissaman and Brown [14] and by Barrows\n\n[15]. Here Lissaman and Brown [14] describes the relevance of the apparent mass effect on\nparafoil-load systems as: ’very significant for vehicles with wing load of the order less than 5\n\n[ _Kg/m_ [2] ] and exceedingly important if the lifting surface is significantly displaced from the major\nmass’. They derive in [14] representations, which approximates the effect with a diagonal mass\nmatrix and diagonal inertia matrix. As result the momentum and angular momentum of the\napparent mass are decoupled. The paper also shows how to derive the mass and inertia matrix.\nBarrows shows in [15] that for an arced parafoil system the decoupled from is in general not\ntrue. The paper presents a method to determine coupled representation of the force and moment\nequations. Also additions to calculated the coupled mass and inertia matrix are presented. In a\nPADS model the apparent mass effect is of importance, since the lifting surface is significantly\ndisplaced from the major mass. The decoupled form is still used as a simpler approximation of\nthe apparent mass, It disregards of diagonal term between the mass and inertia matrix.\n\n**2.3** **Aerodynamics**\n\nOne of the most important parts of the model is the set of aerodynamic forces and moments,\nwhich depend on the aerodynamic coefficients. Obtaining the aerodynamic coefficients or an\nexpression for the coefficients is not trivial. For airplane wings the lifting line theory is suitable\nto derive the aerodynamic coefficients [16], but this theory does not full capture the aerodynamic\neffect of a parafoil [17]. Bennett and Fox [18] describes how a set of coefficient is obtained experimentally. On the basis of this, Lingard [17] and Jann [16] try to extend the lifting line theory\nwith the experimental results. They tried to obtain a general expression based on the parafoil\ngeometry. It is shown that the theory matches the experimental results within a certain regions.\nM¨uller [19] describes a software tool in which the aerodynamic coefficients can be obtained numerically through CFD. The tool is verified with test flight data. In general all methods give set\nof coefficients suitable for an PADS model within a operation range. The CFD method can be\nscaled easily.\n\n**2.4** **Experimental results and validation**\n\nAlthough the papers, given in Sec 2.1-2.3 present a model.

The model Van der Kolf is simulating is a 8 DoF model,\nbut his data can be used to validate general dynamics.\n## **3 Analytical Model**\n\nIn this section the analytical models are derived. First the reference frames are introduced.\nThe orientation, velocity and angular velocity vectors are defined and the rotation matrices are\ngiven. The aerodynamic model, apparent mass and tension line model are described next. Then\nthe 6 DoF model and the 12 DoF models are derived. Lastly, the general model is composted.\nThe model is created using [4], [8], [2] and [9]. These models represents the PADS as one rigid\nbody. With the use of [22] and [13] the 6 DoF model is extended to a 12 DoF model in which\nthe parafoil and the payload are considered as two separate rigid bodies. The two bodies are\nconnected with tension lines. The PADS system is shown as a schematic representation in Figure\n2. The following assumptions are made\n\n The parafoil is treated as a rigid body of fixed shape once completely inflated.\n\n The apparent mass center corresponds to the parafoils center of mass.\n\n**3.1** **Reference frames and rotations**\n\nFour reference frames are defined for modeling purposes. The reference frames are shown in\n\nNorth-East-Down or world frame denoted by _{_ n _}_, which is an inertial frame fixed in a planetary\n\npoint. The frame axis are denoted as _x_ [n], _y_ [n] and _z_ [n] . The _x_ [n] axis is positive towards the north,\nthe _y_ [n] axis is positive towards the east and the _z_ [n] axis is positive pointing towards the center of\nthe planet.\n\nThe model is derived in a body fixed frame. Three body fixed reference frames will be used.\nFirstly, a body fixed frame in the center of mass of the rigid body will be used for the 6 DoF\nmodel. This frame is denoted with _{_ c _}_, with the axis _x_ [c] positive along the longitudinal axis of\nthe PADS in the plane of symmetry, the _z_ [c] axis is perpendicular to the _x_ [c] axis positive pointing\ndown and the _y_ [c] axis is perpendicular to the _x_ [c] - _z_ [c] plane, positive defined by the right-hand rule.\n\nSecondly, a body fixed frame is used in the center of mass of the parafoil, denoted with _{_ p _}_ . The\naxis _x_ [p] is positive along the longitudinal axis of the parafoil in the plane of symmetry, the _z_ [p]\n\naxis is perpendicular to the _x_ [p] axis positive pointing down and the _y_ [p] axis is perpendicular to\nthe _x_ [p] - _z_ [p] plane positive defined by the right-hand rule.\n\nLastly, a body fixed frame is placed in the center of mass of the load. The frame is denoted with\n_{_ l _}_ and the axis _x_ [l] is positive along the longitudinal axis of the load in the plane of symmetry,\nthe _z_ [l] axis is perpendicular to the _x_ [l] axis positive pointing down and the _y_ [l] axis is perpendicular\nto the _x_ [l] - _z_ [l] plane positive defined by the right-hand rule.\n\nIn each body fixed frame the orientation w.r.t. the _{_ n _}_ frame can be represented in Euler\nangles. The angle _phi_ represents a rotation around the x-axis, _theta_ a rotation around the y-axis and\n_psi_ a rotation around the z-axis. This is summarized as _⃗η_ = � _phi_ _theta_ _psi_ [�] _[⊤]_ . In a body fixed frame\nthese angles could also be referred to as roll, pitch and yaw. _mu_ is a specific defined angle. It\ndescribes the relative rotation between the parafoil frame and the rigid body frame around the\ny-axis. The meaning of _mu_ is also shown in Figure 2. The velocity in each frames is denoted with\n_⊤_ _⊤_\n( _V_ _[⃗]_ ) and is decomposed in � _u_ _v_ _w_ � . The angular velocity _⃗ω_ is decomposed as � _p_ _q_ _r_ � .\nThe time derivative of the Euler angles of an arbitrary body fixed frame _{_ b _}_ can be determined\n\nas\n\n_d⃗η_ [b]\n\n_dt_ [(] _[⃗ω]_ [b] _[, ⃗η]_ [b] [) =]\n\n1 sin( _phi_ [b] ) tan( _theta_ [b] ) cos( _phi_ [b] ) tan( _theta_ [b] )\n\n 0 cos( _phi_ [b] ) _−_ sin( _phi_ [b] )\n\n 0 _−_ sin( _phi_ [b] ) cos(1 _theta_ [b] ) cos( _phi_ [b] ) cos(1 _theta_ [b] )\n\n\n\n\n\n_⃗ω_ [b] _._ (1)\n\n~~�~~ ~~�~~ � ~~�~~\n\n_T_\n\nAny vector in a frame can be rotated to another frame with the Euler angles by multiplying with\none or multiple of the corresponding matrices as\n\n _,_ _R_ ( _theta_ [b] ) =\n\n\n\n\n\n _,_\n\n cos(0 _theta_ [b] ) 01 _−_ sin(0 _theta_ [b] )\n\n sin( _theta_ [b] ) 0 cos( _theta_ [b] )\n\n(2)\n\n_R_ ( _psi_ [b] ) =\n\n _−_ cos(sin( _psipsi_ [b][b] )) cos(sin( _psipsi_ [b][b] )) 00\n\n0 0 1\n\n\n\n\n _,_\n\n_R_ ( _phi_ [b] ) =\n\n 10 cos(0 _phi_ [b] ) sin(0 _phi_ [b] )\n\n 0 _−_ sin( _phi_ [b] ) cos( _phi_ [b] )\n\nsuch that a rotation with al three Euler angles would result in\n\n_R_ ( _⃗η_ [b] ) = _R_ ( _psi_ [b] ) _R_ ( _theta_ [b] ) _R_ ( _phi_ [b] ) _._ (3)\n\nThe rotation order matters and is defined as above. By using Euler angles there is a chance\nthat gimbal lock will occur in the model. If for instance, if the angle _theta_ becomes [1] 2 _[π]_ [ the rotation]\n\nmatrices lose a degree of freedom and also its rank. A rotation with _phi_ or _psi_ will result in the\nsame rotation around the z-axis, but a rotation around the x-axis is not possible. The model\nfor the PADS should not operate at _theta_ = [1] 2 _[π]_ [, in normal operation conditions, but it is possible.]\n\nThis phenomena is avoided by expressing the orientation in quaternions. Quaternions are a\ngeneralization of the complex numbers and are formally written as _q_ 0 + _q_ 1 _i_ + _q_ 2 _j_ + _q_ 3 _k_ . _q_ _i_ is a\nreal number. _i, j, k_ are the direction vectors. The properties of _i, j, k_ are given in [23]. By using\nquaternion w.r.t Euler angles an intuitive understanding of the angle is lost. Therefore, the model\nis presented in Euler angles, but implemented in Simulink in quaternions. The orientation in\n_⊤_\nquaternions is described as _⃗q_ = � _q_ 0 _q_ 1 _q_ 2 _q_ 3 � . A vector can be rotated from the world\nframe to an arbitrary body fixed frame _{_ b _}_ with the rotation matrix following [23] defined as\n\n2 � _q_ 0 [b] 3 [b] [+] _[ q]_ 1 [b] 2 [b] � ( _q_ 0 [b] [)] [2] _[ −]_ [(] 1 [b] [)] [2] [ + ", "char_len": 6000}

The other end of the spectrum is the use of a look-up table\nin which the coefficients for specific variables will be obtained through interpolation on known\ndata as is used in [2]. A lot of papers use a mixture between both methods. [10] developed a\nlinearization in a moving operation point.

The moving fluid results in pressure forces on the body. Therefore, the body takes\nadditional energy to move [14]. The effect is not widely used in all applications for a body moving through fluid or air. The apparent mass effect is minimal if the mass of the body is much\nlarger than the mass of the air set into motion. For lighter than air vehicles and parachutes this\neffect can be significant. For systems in which the lifting surface is significantly displaced from\nthe major mass, the apparent mass effect is exceedingly important [14]. Lissaman and Brown\ndescribe in [14] how the energy of the moving fluid can be captured as\n\n2 _T_ = _Au_ [2] + _Bv_ [2] + _Cw_ [2] + _I_ _A_ _p_ [2] + _I_ _B_ _q_ [2] + _I_ _C_ _r_ [2] _._ (12)\n\nFrom here on it is assumes that the mass of the moving fluid is capture in an ellipsoidal body.\nFor each direction a different ellipsoidal body is modeled, as shown in Figure 3. One apparent\nmass center is found such that the apparent mass matrix ( _m_ [p] p m [) and the apparent inertia matrix]\n( _I_ p [p] m [) are defined as]\n\n_I_ A 0 0\n\n 0 _I_ B 0\n\n 0 0 _I_ C\n\n _._ (13)\n\n\n\n_m_ [p]\np m [=]\n\n _A_ 0 _B_ 0 00\n\n0 0 _C_\n\n\n _I_ [p]\n\n p m [=]\n\n\n\nIn [14] expressions are given to determined the apparent mass and inertia matrices. The resulting\nforce ( _F_ _[⃗]_ p [p] m [) and moment (] _[ ⃗M]_ [ p] p m [) of the moving mass in the body are expressed as]\n\n= _−m_ [p] p m _dV_ _[⃗]_ _dt_ p [p] _,_ air _−_ _⃗ω_ p [p] _[×][ m]_ [p] p m _[⃗V]_ [ p] p _,_ air (14)\n\n�\n\n_⃗F_ [p]\np m\n\n_dV_ _[⃗]_ _dt_ p [p] _,_ air _, V_ _[⃗]_ p [p] _,_ air _[, ⃗ω]_ p [p]\n�\n\nand\n\n_⃗M_ [p]\np m\n\n_d⃗ω_ p _d⃗ω_ [p]\n� _dt_ p _[, ⃗V]_ [ p] p _,_ air _[, ⃗ω]_ p [p] � = _−I_ p [p] m _dt_ p _[−]_ _[⃗V]_ [ p] p _,_ air _[×][ m]_ [p] p m _[⃗V]_ [ p] p _,_ air _[−]_ _[⃗ω]_ p [p] _[×][ I]_ p [p] m _[⃗ω]_ p [p] _[.]_ (15)\n\nwhere _V_ _[⃗]_ p [p] _,_ air [is the parafoil velocity.

Instead of looking at one rigid body,\nthe parafoil and the SR or load will be considered as two separate rigid bodies. This makes some\nparts of the modeling easier. There is no need to combine the masses and inertia’s in one mass\nand inertia in the CoM. There are two centers of mass, one for the parafoil and one for the load.\nThe two rigid body should be contraint with respect to each other. Thi makes the modeling\nmore complex. The tension lines allow for relative motion between the parafoil and the load. A\ntension line model is introduced to constrain the relative movement of the load w.r.t. the parafoil.\n\nThe index set of forces and moments _D_ given for the 6 DoF model is separated in a set for\nthe parafoil _P_ and a set for the load _L_ . _P_ consists of the parafoil aerodynamics (p a ), the parafoil\ngravity (p g ), the parafoil apparent mass (p m ) and the parafoil tension line (p t ). This gives _P_\nas _{_ p a _,_ p g _,_ p m _,_ p t _}_ . _L_ consists of the load aerodynamics (l a ), the load gravity (l g ) and the load\ntension line (l t ). This gives _L_ as _{_ l a _,_ l g _,_ l t _}_ . Two sets of equations of motion are used to determine\nthe motion of the parafoil and the load.

First the aerodynamic model is explained. The parafoil can be divided in multiple\npanels. The panels can rotate w.r.t. each other, resulting in a flexible representation of the\nparafoil. The aerodynamic force is then also expressed as a force per panel, instead of one\naerodynamic force for the whole parafoil. In [4] an aerodynamic expression is derived for the\naerodynamic force ( _F_ _[⃗]_ p [p] a _,i_ [) per panel as]\n\n( _u_ [i] i _,_ air [)] [2] [ + (] i [i] _,_ air [)] [2]\n\n(41)\n\n_⃗F_ p [p] a _,_ i [(] _[⃗V]_ [ i] i _,_ air _[, δ]_ [i] [) = 1] 2 _[ρS]_ [i]\n\n_⃗F_ p [p] a _,_ i [(] _[⃗V]_ [ i] i _,_ air _[, δ]_ [i] [) = 1]\n\n _C_ L _δ_ i\n\n�\n\n\n\n\n_w_ i [i] _,_ air\n\n 0\n\n _−u_ [i] i _,_ air\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n_C_ D _δ_ i �( _u_ [i] i _,_ air [)] [2] [ + (] i [i] _,_ air [)] [2] [ + (] i [i] _,_ air [)] [2]\n\n_u_ [i] i _,_ air\n\n _v_ i [i] _,_ air\n\n _w_ i [i] _,_ air\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n _,_\n\nwith _V_ _[⃗]_ i [i] _,_ air [as the air velocity of the panel,] _[ δ]_ [i] [ as the deflection of the panel,] _[ S]_ [i] [ as the aerodynamic]\nreference area of the panel. _C_ L _δ_ i and _C_ D _δ_ i are the aerodynamic lift and drag coefficient of the\npanel, dependent on _δ_ i . The resulting force can be modeled on each panel. The total resulting\naerodynamic moments ( _M_ _[⃗]_ p [p] a [) is]\n\n_⃗M_ p [p] a [(] _[⃗V]_ [ i] _i,_ air _[, δ]_ _[,⃗r]_ _i_ [ p] _[, ⃗η]_ [ i] [) =]\n\n_N_\n�\n\n_i_\n\n� _⃗r_ _i_ [p] _[×][ R]_ [(] _[⃗η]_ [ i] [)] _[⃗F]_ [ p] p a _,i_ [(] _[⃗V]_ [ i] _i,_ air _[, δ]_ [)] � _,_ (42)\n\nhere _N_ is the amount of panels. _⃗r_ i [p] [is the position vector from the parafoil CoM to the panel and]\n_⃗η_ [i] is the orentation of the panel w.r.t. the parafoil. Since in this report the parafoil is considered\nas one rigid body, this aerodynamic expression reduces to the expression given in (6). Therefore,\nthis expression is not implemented.\n\nThe tension line model given in (19) is a simplistic model. A general PADS consists of tens\nof tension lines, instead of just one. The moments due to the tension lines are in reality a result\nof the tension line forces, instead of a torsion stiffness and damping. Multiple tension line forces\nare then modeled between the attachment points of the parafoil and the load. [13] and [22] use\na similar approach. The tension lines between the parafoil and the payload are modeled as multiple 1D spring-damper systems, which are only able to handle load in one direction and only if\nthe line is stretched. compressing the line is not realistic, thus creating a nonlinear model. The\ntension force ( _F_ t ) is expressed as\n\n_F_ t = _−k_ ( _l −_ _l_ eq ) _−_ _dl_ [˙] (43)\n\nwith _l_ being the length of the line, _l_ eq as the equilibrium length, _k_ is the spring constant and\n_d_ is the damping constant. In a three dimensional space it is assumed that the force directly\ncounteracts the excitation. Only the velocity is damped, which is inline with the excitation. This\nresults in a tension force ( _F_ _[⃗]_ t [p] [) in one of the load attachments points as]\n\n�\n\n_⃗F_ t [l] [=] _[ −][k⃗r]_ [ l] t �1 _−_ _||⃗rl_ te [l] q _[||]_ [2]\n\n_−_ _d_\n�\n\n_⃗r_ ˙ lt _⊤_ _⃗r_ t [l]\n� _⃗r_ t [l] _[⊤]_ _⃗r_ t [l]\n\n_⃗r_ t [l] _[.]_ (44)\n\nThe length _l_ is replaced with the position vector from the attachment point on the parafoil to\nthe attachment point on the load ( _⃗r_ t [l] [).

Both the 6 DoF model\nand the 12 DoF model are implemented, such that it is possible to enable and disable the\ncontributions to the model. The added added effect of the contributions can be compared. The\ncontributions which can be enabled and disabled are the gravity, the parafoil aerodynamics, the\nload aerodynamics and the apparent mass. Sec. 4.1 will show the Simulink implementation and\nSec. 4.2 and 4.3 show the simulation results. Two videos are created with Simscape. One shows\nthe simulation result of the 6 DoF model and the other video shows the same simulation for the\n\n12 DoF model. They are found at `[https://youtu.be/vr0LlCARQw4](https://youtu.be/vr0LlCARQw4)` and `[https://youtu.be/](https://youtu.be/CT686KLwrkk)`\n\n`[CT686KLwrkk](https://youtu.be/CT686KLwrkk)` .\n\n**4.1** **Simulink model**\n\nBoth the 6 DoF and the 12 DoF have a similar implementation. Therefore, only the 12 DoF\nSimulink model will be discussed. The model overview is shown in Figure 4 The model consists\nof 5 part:\n\n Input\n\n Wind model\n\n Simscape model\n\n Forces and Moments\n\n Model data\n\n Output data\n\nThe Input consists of the input variables of the model. In this case the left and right deflection\nare given as an vector based on a time vector. The wind model determines the wind velocity\nvector in the position of the parafoil and the load. A simple wind model is implemented. The\nwind velocity is only based on the position in the world frame. The Simscape model, is based on\nthe Simscape multibody library and captures the motion of the parafoil and the load, based on\nthe masses, inertias, input forces and input moments. The gravity is also part of the Simscape\nmodel and the tension line between the parafoil and load is modeled with a Simscape Cartesian\njoint and a gimbal joint with internal spring-damper dynamics. In the Simscape models all the\nneeded states are measured. The measure states can be viewed in the model data section. The\n\nforces and moments determine the aerodynamic forces and moments and the apparent mass force\nand moment based on the measured states. In the section a corresponding Matlab model is\ncalled, which calculates the forces and moments, corresponding with the presented equation in\nSection 3. The output data determines the specific defined outputs of the model.\n\nTo elaborate a bit on the used Simscape library. Figure 5 shows the implementation of the\nparafoil. The parafoil frame is connected through a 6 DoF joint to the world frame. On the\nside of the parafoil frame, a mass block is connected including the parafoil mass and inertia,\na visualization file is connected and an external force and moments block is connected. The\nsensors are connected between the world frame and the parafoil frame measuring the position\nand orientation of the parafoil frame with respect of the world frame and the body velocity and\nbody angular velocity in the parafoil frame. The measured state are connected the output of the\nSimulink block and also send to the Matlab workspace.\n\nThe Simulink model can be called from Matlab as following. The simulation folder contains\nthe sub-folders ’models’, with the models of the SR and ’functions’ with all the needed Matlab\nfunction to run the model. The parameter file can also be found in this folder. These folders are\nadded to the Matlab path. As following a struct Enable is defined, enabling the model contri\n\nbutions. additionally, Enable.W enables the wind model. Enable.Database enables a look-up\ntable for the aerodynamic coefficient otherwise a linear model is used. Enable.Interp enables\nlinear interpolation between the coefficients in the aerodynamic look-up table. As following the\nsystem parameters are loaded. The input vector is created based on a time vector and the state\nvector at _t_ = 0 is defined. As last the Simulink model is called and the simulation results are\nloaded in Matlab.

First the steady state flight behavior will be analyzed for the 6 DoF model\nand the 12 DoF model. Next, the dynamic behavior is analyzed. When the PADS is dropped\nfrom a height, the system will converge to steady state motion. The velocity and the angular\nvelocity of the model become constant as long as the model is not disturbed by disturbances or a\nchange in the control inputs. For each constant control input the model converges to a different\nsteady-state point. The steady state motion of the model can be found as equilibrium points\nof the body velocity and the body angular velocity. The EoM should be solved, such that the\nderivatives of the body velocity and angular velocity are zero. The corresponding velocity and", "char_len": 5935}

The corresponding velocity and\nangular velocity is the equilibrium point. A constant pitch and roll angle are also included. The\nmodel dynamics are dependent on those. For each equilibrium point there is a corresponding\nconstant control input. The equilibrium point and the corresponding control input always come\nin pairs. Solving the system for these equilibrium points is difficult, due to the complexity of the\naerodynamic forces, but the attractive equilibrium points can be found by means of simulation\nor a successive root-finding algorithm, like the Newton–Raphson method. The parameter set\ngiven in [21] is used for simulation, since the set of parameters is all most complete and the\npaper presents results with which later on the model can be compared with. Since landing the\nload/SR is of interest, the flight behavior from the loads point of view is analyzed, thus when\nis referred to the velocity, angles or angular velocity, the corresponding state of the load in the\nload frame is meant.\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n\n0.5\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-5\n\n0 5 10 15 20 -10\n\nWhen simulating the system with a constant control input, The velocity component _⃗v_ l [l] [converges]\nto zero, as well as the angular velocity ( _⃗ω_ l [l] [) and the roll angle (] _[phi]_ [l] [). The yaw angle (] _[psi]_ [l] [) can be]\nany constant value. The velocity components _u_ [l] l [and] _[ w]_ l [l] [and the angle] _[ theta]_ [l] [ converge to a steady]\nstate, as is shown in Figure 6. and 7. These are of interest to find the equilibrium point. By\nsubstituting the known values in the EoM of both models, the system can be reduced to a force\nand moment balance between the aerodynamic forces and moments and the gravity force. Solving the system analytically is complex due to the expressions of the aerodynamics. It is possible\nto determine a local Jacobian of the system, but this takes up to a couple of minutes. This\nis too slow to use in an successive algorithm. Therefore, the Broyden’s method is used to find\nstate velocities and angles. Figure 6 shows multiple simulations from different initial conditions\ntogether with the approximated equilibrium point for zero control deflections. The figure shows\nall simulations converging to the same point of steady state motion. Broyden’s method gives\nthe same equilibrium point. Figure 7 shows similar results for a constant symmetric deflection\nof 0.5. The resulting equilibrium point is determined for each constant symmetric deflection as\nshown in Figure 8. The figures show the ability of the parafoil to brake its forward velocity ( _u_ [l] l [)]\nby 3.5 [m/s]. It increases its downward velocity slightly ( _u_ [l] l [) by 0.3 [m/s]. The apparent mass]\neffect decreases the forward velocity by 1.5 [m/s] and increases the downward velocity with 0.2\n\n[m/s]. It increases the pitch ( _theta_ [l] ) with 0.11 [rad].

The right deflection is kept at zero. The left deflection is varied from 0 to 1. The simulations show that the\nsystem reaches a steady state motion, with a steady state velocity, angular velocity and a steady\nstate pitching and rolling angle. The yaw angle does not converge. To find the equilibrium point,\nthe system should be solved for all derivatives being zero with exception of the yaw rate and\nthe position. Since Brodyen’s method is unable to converge, the equilibrium point is determined\nbased on the simulations. Figure 9 and 10 show the velocity and angular velocity converging to\na single point for 0.5 asymmetric deflection. The same figures can be made for other asymmetric\ndeflections.\n\nan asymmetric deflection varying from .25 to 1. The side velocity ( _v_ l [l] [) increases with 1 [m/s]]\nfrom .25 to 1 asymmetric deflection. The downwards velocity decreases with 0.2 [m/s] for the 6\nDoF and 0.4 [m/s] for the 12 DoF model.

The roll angle decreases from -0.1 [rad] to -0.65 [rad]. the pitch angle decreases\nto -0.3 [rad] to -0.55 [rad]. The apparent mass effect gives a clear difference in all velocities,\nangular velocities and body angles. Moreover, the figures show divergences between the 6 DoF\nmodel and 12 DoF model. Especially the downwards velocity diverges with 0.2 [m/s] difference\nfor _δ_ _a_ = 1. This differences could be caused by a small relative roll and pitch angle between the\nparafoil and the load.\n\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n1.4\n\n1.2\n\n0.8\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.5\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.8\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n-0.6\n0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n**4.3** **Dynamic model behavior**", "char_len": 5301}

Figure 14 shows\nthe dynamic behavior of the forward velocity and the downward velocity and the pitch for a\nsymmetric deflection of 0.25 and 0.75. The forward velocity gives a rise time of 2 [s], a settling\ntime of 7.5 [s] and a relative overshoot of 0.33 [-]. The apparent mass adds a steady state offset\nin the flight behavior. It does not seem to affect the dynamic flight behavior. The 6 DoF and\n12 DoF model do not show differences. The downwards velocity has a rise time of 0.2 [s] and a\nsettling time of 4 [s] and a relative overshoot of 0.2 [-]. The 12 DoF model shows some additional\noscillations due to the spring damper connecting the parafoil and the load. The 12 DoF model\n\nhas a rise time of 0.05 [s] and a settling time of 5 [s] and a relative overshoot of 2.3 [-]. The apparent mass only shifts the behavior. The pitch _theta_ [l] oscillates with a rise time of 0.1 [s], but a settling\ntime of over 15 [s]. The relative overshoot is 0.3 [-]. Moreover, the apparent mass only adds\na steady state shift. The 12 DoF does not show additional flight behavior w.r.t. the 6 DoF model.\n\nThe same analysis can be made for an asymmetric deflection. The control deflection is changed\nfrom zero deflection to a constant asymmetric deflection of 0.25 and 0.75. The dynamic response\nof the flight behavior is shown in 15-17. The exact characteristics of the response are given in\n\nand downward velocity as well as in the angle _theta_ [l] . A steady state in the flight dynamics is introduced in the side velocity, the angular velocities and the roll angle. They all start from zero and\nconverge to a constant value. Differences between the 6 DoF and 12 DoF model are visible.

For constant asymmetric deflection the model does not lead to a equilibrium\npoint. As a result the term _f_ ( _x_ _[∗]_ _, u_ _[∗]_ _, w_ _[∗]_ ) is not zero. This term is seen as a constant input, by\nintroducing _ν_ as an auxiliary input. By expressing the system variables ( _x −_ _x_ _[∗]_ ) as ˜ _x_, ( _u −_ _u_ _[∗]_ )\nas ˜ _u_, ( _w −_ _w_ _[∗]_ ) as ˜ _w_ and _y −_ _h_ ( _x_ _[∗]_ ) as ˜ _y_ the linearized system is described as\n\n_x_ ˙˜ _≈_ _Ax_ ˜ + _ν_ + _W_ ˜ _w_\n\n˜ ˜ (58)\n_y ≈_ _Cx._\n\nhere, _ν_ is expressed as\n_ν_ = _Bu_ ˜ + _f_ ( _x_ _[∗]_ _, u_ _[∗]_ _, w_ _[∗]_ ) (59)\n\nSince the point ( _x_ _[∗]_ _, u_ _[∗]_ _, w_ _[∗]_ ) is not necessarily an equilibrium point of the system, the system\nis linearized along an equilibrium trajectory. The system is linearized in all the points in the\ntrajectory. All these models together result in a linear parameter varying (LPV) model. An LPV\nmodel varies over the scheduling variable _p_ . The the scheduling variable _p_ ( _t_ ) may vary over time\nand is assumed to be exogenous. This results in a LPV system as\n\n˙˜\n_x ≈_ _A_ ( _p_ )˜ _x_ + _ν_ (˜ _u, p_ ) + _W_ ( _p_ ) ˜ _w_\n\n˜ (60)\n_y ≈_ _C_ ( _p_ )˜ _x._\n\nwith _p_ related to the equilibrium trajectory as\n\n_p_ = Ψ( _x_ _[∗]_ _, u_ _[∗]_ _, w_ _[∗]_ ) (61)\n\nIn this report a linearization is made for zero wind disturbance. For a constant input, the states\n\nof the model converge to an equilibrium position. The model can be linearized in this equilibrium\npoint and one linear system is obtained for each constant input. Not all the states converge to\nan equilibrium point. In the 6 DoF model this are the position vectors and the yaw angle. The\nderivative of the yaw angle becomes constant and can be embedded as a constant input to the\nsystem. This is also done in (59). The position does not affect the input-output relation and can\nbe taken out of the linearized model.\n\nThe position vectors and the yaw angles do not converge to an equilibrium point in the 12\nDoF model. This is problematic since the dynamics depend on these states. The tension force is\ndependent on the positions and the yaw angles. This can be solved by recognizing that the model\nis only dependent on the relative position ( _⃗r_ t [p] [) and the relative yaw angle (] _[psi]_ [ t] [), expressed in the]\nparafoil frame.

The same hold for the parafoil yaw angle. The load\nyaw angle does not contribute to the systems dynamics, but is an output.

Van der\nKolf simulates an 8 DoF model. The paper presents the following variables for the system, with\nwhich the models can be validated:\n\n The angle of attack of the parafoil ( _alpha_ p ),\n\n The parafoil pitch angle ( _theta_ p ),\n\n The load glide path angle ( _γ_ l ),\n\n The horizontal velocity of the load ( _V_ h [n] [),]\n\n The vertical velocity of the load ( _V_ v [n] [),]\n\nIn [10] the corresponding 8 DoF model is presented. The load is able to rotate relative to the\nparafoil with a pitch and yaw angle. Some differences between the models are expected due to\nthe different model order. Moreover, the model used, do not include the apparent mass. The\nadded behavior to the flight dynamics is already discussed. therefore, the validation will be\ndone without the apparent mass effect. First the steady state flight behavior, resulting from a\nconstant symmetric deflection is compared. The symmetric deflections varies from 0 to 1 [-].\nNext the steady state flight behavior, as a result of an asymmetric deflection, is compared. The\nasymmetric deflection varies between 0 and 1 [-]. Lastly, both the dynamic flight behavior as\na result of an symmetric deflection and an asymmetric deflection are compared to the reported\nsimulations of Van der Kolf.\n\n**6.1** **Steady state flight behavior**\n\nThe horizontal load velocity is calculated as\n\n_V_ h [n] [=]\n�\n\n( _u_ [n] l [)] [2] [ + (] l [n] [)] [2] (64)\n\nThe vertical velocity equals the _w_ l [n] [and the glide path angle can be determined as]\n\n_γ_ [l] = tan _[−]_ [1] _V_ nv\n� _V_ h [n]\n\n(65)\n�\n\nVariable Van der Kolf 6DoF model 12DoF model\n\n_V_ h ~~[n]~~ [[m/s]] 12.99 12.98 12.98\n_V_ v [n] [[m/s]] 5.14 5.22 5.22\n_γ_ [l] [deg] 21.63 21.91 21.91\n_alpha_ [p] [deg] 3.53 3.53 3.53\n_theta_ [p] [deg] -18.1 -18.39 -18.37\n\nvalues of Van der Kolf.

The\n\nsteady state flight behavior, as a result of an constant symmetric deflection, of the 6DoF and\n12Dof model with the reported values are shown in Figure 22. The found steady state values\nare almost the same for zero deflection but diverge for increasing symmetric deflections. For a\nsymmetric deflection of 1 the 6DoF and the 12DoF model show as sudden increase w.r.t. to the\nlower deflections.

The steady states is the same for zero deflection, but diverge for increasing asymmetric\ndeflections. The horizontal velocity stays between 13 and 12.4 [m/s] for both models, while the\nreported velocity increases first to 14.4 [m/s] and decreases for asymmetric deflections higher\nthan 0.7 [-] to 12.5 [m/s]. The maximum difference is 1.9 [m/s]. The vertical velocity are both\nincreasing. The modeled velocity increases slower than the reported, leading to a difference\nof maximal 7 [m/s]. The yaw rate gives a maximum difference of 0.2 [rad/s]. The absolute\ndifferences are shown in Table 4. The difference in turning rate is not given for symmetric\ndeflections. The system is not turning for a symmetric deflection and therefore it is also not\nreported by Van der Kolf.\n\n|Col1|6DoF|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|||~~12Do~~<br>Van d|~~F~~<br>er Kolf|~~F~~<br>er Kolf||\n\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n13.5\n\n12.5\n\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\nLoad word velocity and yaw rate\n\n0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n|Variable Model|δ<br>s|Col3|Col4|Col5|δ<br>a|Col7|Col8|Col9|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|**Variable**<br>**Model**|0.25 [-]|0.5 [-]|0.75 [-]|1 [|-]<br>0.25 [-]|0.5 [-]|0.75 [-]|1 [-]|\n|Dif._ V_ n<br>h [m/s]<br>6DoF<br>12DoF|0.04<br>0.04|0.24<br>0.24|0.19<br>0.19|0.2<br>0.2|7<br>0.42<br>7<br>0.41|0.78<br>0.76|1.52<br>1.49|0.49<br>0.53|\n|Dif._ V_ h<br>v [m/s]<br>6DoF<br>12DoF|0.07<br>0.07|0.15<br>0.15|0.28<br>0.28|0.4<br>0.4|9<br>0.36<br>9<br>0.36|0.78<br>0.77|7.11<br>7.10|6.77<br>6.74|\n|Dif.˙_psi_l [rad/s]<br>6DoF<br>12DoF|||||0.02<br>0.02|0.20<br>0.20|0.05<br>0.05|0.07<br>0.07|\n\n**6.2** **Dynamical flight behavior**\n\nThe same model variables are used to compare the dynamic flight behavior as was used for the\nsteady states flight behavior.

First of all, Yakimenko argues in [4] that\none of the important parts of the aerodynamic drag in a PADS is the line drag. This is not\ndiscussed in this report, but could be easily taken into account in the sum of forces and moments\nin the EoM of the parafoil and the load.\n\nThe simulation parameters used in Sec. 4 are also the parameter set given by Van der Kolf\nin [21]. This set is extensive, but does not include average parafoil thickness and the arc angle of\nthe parafoil. These are needed to determine the apparent mass and inertia matrices. Therefore\nthese parameters are estimated. How accurate these estimations are and how they influence\nthe overall apparent mass effect is not analyzed. Next, Yakimenko argues in [4], that the term\n_⃗V_ p [p] _,_ air _[×][ m]_ [p] p m _[⃗V]_ [ p] p _,_ air [can be neglected in the apparent mass effect, since it could be included in]\nthe aerodynamic expressions. It remains unclear when this is the case or when not. The term\n_⃗V_ p [p] _,_ air _[×][ m]_ [p] p m _[⃗V]_ [ p] p _,_ air [is the main contribution in the steady state offset due to the apparent mass in]\nSec 4. For instance consider the system in steady state for a constant symmetric deflection input.\nThe angular velocity, acceleration and angular acceleration are zero. This simplifies the apparent\nmass effect to only _V_ _[⃗]_ p [p] _,_ air _[×][ m]_ [p] p m _[⃗V]_ [ p] p _,_ air [, resulting in the steady state offsets given in Figure 8.]\n\nA note can be made on the model comparison in the validation. The steady state behavior\nof the model is in essence a force moment balance of the aerodynamic effect, the gravity and\nthe apparent mass. Therefore, the steady state is highly dependent on the accuracy of the\naerodynamic force and moment. In this research the aerodynamics presented in [21] is used, in\nwhich already some numerical mistakes are found in the presented matrices. Next to this the\npresented model uses a nonlinear expression to constrain the relative yaw between the parafoil\nand the load. The 12 DoF uses a linear spring-damper system. These two things together with\nthe difference in model order, most likely result in the differences present in the validation. The\nvalidation shows that the model has the same behavior as the reported model for zero deflection.\nSimilar flight behavior is shown for symmetric deflections. The steady state behavior diverges\nwith maximal 0.4 [m/s]. For asymmetric deflections the steady state behavior is different. The\ndynamic flight behavior is similar in the velocity, but the dynamic flight behavior is different in\nthe yaw rate.\n\nIn the future this research can be extended by weakening the rigid body assumption of the\nparafoil and dividing it in multiple panels. The panels can rotate with respect to each other.\nThis is briefly explained in Sec. 3.7 and an expression for the aerodynamic force per panel is\npresented there. Furthermore, a tension line representation could be extended towards modeling\nreal tension lines, in a realistic configuration. The tension moments could then also be modeled\nas a result of the tension force. This is also briefly discussed in Sec. 3.7.\n\nTo conclude on the research question: ”Which dynamic effects acting on the SR during the\nterminal guidance phase should be considered, to describe the flight dynamics of the Space Rider\nw.r.t. the desired landing precision and landing constraints of the GNC system? The literature\nreview gives an expectation”. The 6 DoF model describes the overall flight dynamics based on\nthe aerodynamics, gravity and the apparent mass. The 12 DoF model adds internal dynamics\ndue to relative motion between the load and the parafoil. The following effect are considered\nrelevant in the literature. The gravity, aerodynamics and the apparent mass. The results of the\nconstructed models, show that The 6 DoF model describes indeed the overall flight dynamics.\nThe steady state flight behavior of the 6 DoF model is similar to the steady state flight behavior\n\nof the 12 DoF. Small differences are visible, when in the 12 DoF model, the load is rotated\nrelative to the parafoil. The 12 DoF model adds oscillations to the dynamic behavior, due to\nthe spring-damper system used for the tension line. This is also visible in the linearization. The\nfrequency responses of the 6 DoF and the 12 DoF models are similar, but the response of the 12\nDoF model shows additional dynamics. The gravity and the aerodynamics act similar in both\nmodels. The model is simulated with and without the apparent mass effect. Comparing the\nresults shows, that the gravity and aerodynamics account for most of the flight dynamics. The\napparent mass adds a steady state offset in the flight behavior.\n\nThe question remains how relevant this is to the SR terminal guidance phase. The gravity,\naerodynamics and apparent mass influence the flight behavior, such that is would be important\nto include the dynamic effects for position, velocity or heading control. In terms of position,\nvelocity or heading, the 12 DoF does not add any flight behavior, compared to the 6 DoF model.\nThe 12DoF model adds dynamics behavior, which is relevant for a changing wind disturbance, or\nduring the landing. The 12 DoF model could show how the load is oscillating w.r.t. the parafoil\nduring a landing. This influences the impact of the landing.\n\nIn the future, the model developed in this report can be used to improve the GNC of the\nSpace Rider during the terminal descent phase. The constructed model and the LPV description\nof the model along an equilibrium trajectory, give a first impressions for a control strategy. The\nlinearizations show that the nonlinear model has moving resonances and varying low frequency\ngains. Therefore, it is expected that a nonlinear controller will results i", "char_len": 6000}
